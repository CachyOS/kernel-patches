Subject: [PATCH 10/19] Implement AMD Pstate EPP Driver

This patchset implements one new AMD CPU frequency driver
`amd-pstate-epp` instance for better performance and power control.
CPPC has a parameter called energy preference performance (EPP).
The EPP is used in the CCLK DPM controller to drive the frequency that a core
is going to operate during short periods of activity.
EPP values will be utilized for different OS profiles (balanced, performance, power savings).

AMD Energy Performance Preference (EPP) provides a hint to the hardware
if software wants to bias toward performance (0x0) or energy efficiency (0xff)
The lowlevel power firmware will calculate the runtime frequency according to the EPP preference
value. So the EPP hint will impact the CPU cores frequency responsiveness.

We use the RAPL interface with "perf" tool to get the energy data of the package power.
Performance Per Watt (PPW) Calculation:

The PPW calculation is referred by below paper:
https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoftware.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fdevelop%2Fexternal%2Fus%2Fen%2Fdocuments%2Fperformance-per-what-paper.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7CPerry.Yuan%40amd.com%7Cac66e8ce98044e9b062708d9ab47c8d8%7C3dd8961fe4884e608e11a82d994e183d%7C0%7C0%7C637729147708574423%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=TPOvCE%2Frbb0ptBreWNxHqOi9YnVhcHGKG88vviDLb00%3D&amp;reserved=0

Below formula is referred from below spec to measure the PPW:

(F / t) / P = F * t / (t * E) = F / E,

"F" is the number of frames per second.
"P" is power measured in watts.
"E" is energy measured in joules.

+AMD Pstate Driver Operation Modes
+=================================
+
+``amd_pstate`` CPPC has two operation modes: CPPC Autonomous(active) mode and
+CPPC non-autonomous(passive) mode.
+active mode and passive mode can be chosen by different kernel parameters.
+When in Autonomous mode, CPPC ignores requests done in the Desired Performance
+Target register and takes into account only the values set to the Minimum requested
+performance, Maximum requested performance, and Energy Performance Preference
+registers. When Autonomous is disabled, it only considers the Desired Performance Target.
+
+Active Mode
+------------
+
+``amd_pstate=active``
+
+This is the low-level firmware control mode which is implemented by ``amd_pstate_epp``
+driver with ``amd_pstate=active`` passed to the kernel in the command line.
+In this mode, ``amd_pstate_epp`` driver provides a hint to the hardware if software

+``amd-pstate`` exposes several global attributes (files) in ``sysfs`` to

+        one of the possible values of it and, if successful, writing one of
