+``amd-pstate`` CPU Performance Scaling Driver
+===============================================

+
+
+Introduction
+===================
+
+``amd-pstate`` is the AMD CPU performance scaling driver that introduces a
+new CPU frequency control mechanism on modern AMD APU and CPU series in
+Linux kernel. The new mechanism is based on Collaborative Processor
+Performance Control (CPPC) which provides finer grain frequency management
+than legacy ACPI hardware P-States. Current AMD CPU/APU platforms are using
+the ACPI P-states driver to manage CPU frequency and clocks with switching
+only in 3 P-states. CPPC replaces the ACPI P-states controls, allows a
+flexible, low-latency interface for the Linux kernel to directly
+communicate the performance hints to hardware.
+
+``amd-pstate`` leverages the Linux kernel governors such as ``schedutil``,
+``ondemand``, etc. to manage the performance hints which are provided by
+CPPC hardware functionality that internally follows the hardware
+specification (for details refer to AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual
+Volume 2: System Programming [1]_). Currently ``amd-pstate`` supports basic
+frequency control function according to kernel governors on some of the
+Zen2 and Zen3 processors, and we will implement more AMD specific functions
+in future after we verify them on the hardware and SBIOS.
+
+
+AMD CPPC Overview
+=======================
+
+Collaborative Processor Performance Control (CPPC) interface enumerates a
+continuous, abstract, and unit-less performance value in a scale that is
+not tied to a specific performance state / frequency. This is an ACPI
+standard [2]_ which software can specify application performance goals and
+hints as a relative target to the infrastructure limits. AMD processors
+provides the low latency register model (MSR) instead of AML code
+interpreter for performance adjustments. ``amd-pstate`` will initialize a
+``struct cpufreq_driver`` instance ``amd_pstate_driver`` with the callbacks
+to manage each performance update behavior. ::

+
+
+.. _perf_cap:
+
+AMD CPPC Performance Capability
+--------------------------------
+
+Highest Performance (RO)
+.........................
+
+It is the absolute maximum performance an individual processor may reach,
+assuming ideal conditions. This performance level may not be sustainable
+for long durations and may only be achievable if other platform components
+are in a specific state; for example, it may require other processors be in
+an idle state. This would be equivalent to the highest frequencies
+supported by the processor.
+
+Nominal (Guaranteed) Performance (RO)
+......................................
+
+It is the maximum sustained performance level of the processor, assuming
+ideal operating conditions. In absence of an external constraint (power,
+thermal, etc.) this is the performance level the processor is expected to
+be able to maintain continuously. All cores/processors are expected to be
+able to sustain their nominal performance state simultaneously.
+
+Lowest non-linear Performance (RO)
+...................................
+
+It is the lowest performance level at which nonlinear power savings are
+achieved, for example, due to the combined effects of voltage and frequency
+scaling. Above this threshold, lower performance levels should be generally
+more energy efficient than higher performance levels. This register
+effectively conveys the most efficient performance level to ``amd-pstate``.
+
+Lowest Performance (RO)
+........................
+
+It is the absolute lowest performance level of the processor. Selecting a
+performance level lower than the lowest nonlinear performance level may
+cause an efficiency penalty but should reduce the instantaneous power
+consumption of the processor.
+
+AMD CPPC Performance Control
+------------------------------
+
+``amd-pstate`` passes performance goals through these registers. The
+register drives the behavior of the desired performance target.
+
+Minimum requested performance (RW)
+...................................
+
+``amd-pstate`` specifies the minimum allowed performance level.
+
+Maximum requested performance (RW)
+...................................
+
+``amd-pstate`` specifies a limit the maximum performance that is expected
+to be supplied by the hardware.
+
+Desired performance target (RW)
+...................................
+
+``amd-pstate`` specifies a desired target in the CPPC performance scale as
+a relative number. This can be expressed as percentage of nominal
+performance (infrastructure max). Below the nominal sustained performance
+level, desired performance expresses the average performance level of the
+processor subject to hardware. Above the nominal performance level,
+processor must provide at least nominal performance requested and go higher
+if current operating conditions allow.
+
+Energy Performance Preference (EPP) (RW)
+.........................................
+
+Provides a hint to the hardware if software wants to bias toward performance
+(0x0) or energy efficiency (0xff).
+
+
+Key Governors Support
+=======================
+
+``amd-pstate`` can be used with all the (generic) scaling governors listed
+by the ``scaling_available_governors`` policy attribute in ``sysfs``. Then,
+it is responsible for the configuration of policy objects corresponding to
+CPUs and provides the ``CPUFreq`` core (and the scaling governors attached
+to the policy objects) with accurate information on the maximum and minimum
+operating frequencies supported by the hardware. Users can check the
+``scaling_cur_freq`` information comes from the ``CPUFreq`` core.
+
+``amd-pstate`` mainly supports ``schedutil`` and ``ondemand`` for dynamic
+frequency control. It is to fine tune the processor configuration on
+``amd-pstate`` to the ``schedutil`` with CPU CFS scheduler. ``amd-pstate``
+registers adjust_perf callback to implement the CPPC similar performance
+update behavior. It is initialized by ``sugov_start`` and then populate the
+CPU's update_util_data pointer to assign ``sugov_update_single_perf`` as
+the utilization update callback function in CPU scheduler. CPU scheduler
+will call ``cpufreq_update_util`` and assign the target performance
+according to the ``struct sugov_cpu`` that utilization update belongs to.
+Then ``amd-pstate`` updates the desired performance according to the CPU
+scheduler assigned.
+
+
+Processor Support
+=======================
+
+The ``amd-pstate`` initialization will fail if the _CPC in ACPI SBIOS is
+not existed at the detected processor, and it uses ``acpi_cpc_valid`` to
+check the _CPC existence. All Zen based processors support legacy ACPI
+hardware P-States function, so while the ``amd-pstate`` fails to be
+initialized, the kernel will fall back to initialize ``acpi-cpufreq``
+driver.
+
+There are two types of hardware implementations for ``amd-pstate``: one is
+`Full MSR Support <perf_cap_>`_ and another is `Shared Memory Support
+<perf_cap_>`_. It can use :c:macro:`X86_FEATURE_AMD_CPPC` feature flag (for
+details refer to Processor Programming Reference (PPR) for AMD Family
+19h Model 21h, Revision B0 Processors [3]_) to indicate the different
+types. ``amd-pstate`` is to register different ``amd_pstate_perf_funcs``
+instances for different hardware implementations.
+
+Currently, some of Zen2 and Zen3 processors support ``amd-pstate``. In the
+future, it will be supported on more and more AMD processors.
+
+Full MSR Support
+-----------------
+
+Some new Zen3 processors such as Cezanne provide the MSR registers directly
+while the :c:macro:`X86_FEATURE_AMD_CPPC` CPU feature flag is set.
+``amd-pstate`` can handle the MSR register to implement the fast switch
+function in ``CPUFreq`` that can shrink latency of frequency control on the
+interrupt context.
+
+Shared Memory Support
+----------------------
+
+If :c:macro:`X86_FEATURE_AMD_CPPC` CPU feature flag is not set, that means
+the processor supports shared memory solution. In this case, ``amd-pstate``
+uses the ``cppc_acpi`` helper methods to implement the callback functions
+of ``amd_pstate_perf_funcs``.
+
+
+AMD P-States and ACPI hardware P-States always can be supported in one
+processor. But AMD P-States has the higher priority and if it is enabled
+with :c:macro:`MSR_AMD_CPPC_ENABLE` or ``cppc_set_enable``, it will respond
+to the request from AMD P-States.
+
+
+User Space Interface in ``sysfs``
+==================================
+
+``amd-pstate`` exposes several global attributes (files) in ``sysfs`` to
+control its functionality at the system level. They located in the
+``/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policyX/`` directory and affect all CPUs. ::
+
+ root@hr-test1:/home/ray# ls /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/*amd*
+ /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/amd_pstate_highest_perf

+This attribute is read-only.
+

+

+allowed to set in percent of the maximum supported CPPC performance level
+(Please see the lowest non-linear performance in `AMD CPPC Performance
+Capability <perf_cap_>`_).
+This attribute is read-only.
+
+``amd_pstate_lowest_perf``
+
+The lowest physical CPPC performance. The minimum CPU frequency can be read
+back from ``cpuinfo`` member of ``cpufreq_policy``, so we won't expose it
+here.
+This attribute is read-only.
+
+
+``amd-pstate`` vs ``acpi-cpufreq``
+======================================
+
+On majority of AMD platforms supported by ``acpi-cpufreq``, the ACPI tables
+provided by the platform firmware used for CPU performance scaling, but
+only provides 3 P-states on AMD processors.
+However, on modern AMD APU and CPU series, it provides the collaborative
+processor performance control according to ACPI protocol and customize this
+for AMD platforms. That is fine-grain and continuous frequency range
+instead of the legacy hardware P-states. ``amd-pstate`` is the kernel
+module which supports the new AMD P-States mechanism on most of future AMD
+platforms. The AMD P-States mechanism will be the more performance and energy
+efficiency frequency management method on AMD processors.
+
+``cpupower`` tool support for ``amd-pstate``
+===============================================
+
+``amd-pstate`` is supported on ``cpupower`` tool that can be used to dump the frequency
+information. And it is in progress to support more and more operations for new
+``amd-pstate`` module with this tool. ::
+

+
+
+Diagnostics and Tuning
+=======================
+
+Trace Events
+--------------
+
+There are two static trace events that can be used for ``amd-pstate``
+diagnostics.  One of them is the cpu_frequency trace event generally used
+by ``CPUFreq``, and the other one is the ``amd_pstate_perf`` trace event
+specific to ``amd-pstate``.  The following sequence of shell commands can
+be used to enable them and see their output (if the kernel is generally
+configured to support event tracing). ::
+
+ root@hr-test1:/home/ray# cd /sys/kernel/tracing/

+
+The cpu_frequency trace event will be triggered either by the ``schedutil`` scaling
+governor (for the policies it is attached to), or by the ``CPUFreq`` core (for the
+policies with other scaling governors).

+ * Intel remapped NVMe device support.
+ *
+ * Copyright (c) 2019 Endless Mobile, Inc.
+ * Author: Daniel Drake <drake@endlessm.com>
+ *
+ * Some products ship by default with the SATA controller in "RAID" or
+ * "Intel RST Premium With Intel Optane System Acceleration" mode. Under this
+ * mode, which we refer to as "remapped NVMe" mode, any installed NVMe
+ * devices disappear from the PCI bus, and instead their I/O memory becomes
+ * available within the AHCI device BARs.
+ *
+ * This scheme is understood to be a way of avoiding usage of the standard
+ * Windows NVMe driver under that OS, instead mandating usage of Intel's
+ * driver instead, which has better power management, and presumably offers
+ * some RAID/disk-caching solutions too.
+ *
+ * Here in this driver, we support the remapped NVMe mode by claiming the
+ * AHCI device and creating a fake PCIe root port. On the new bus, the
+ * original AHCI device is exposed with only minor tweaks. Then, fake PCI
+ * devices corresponding to the remapped NVMe devices are created. The usual
+ * ahci and nvme drivers are then expected to bind to these devices and
+ * operate as normal.
+ *
+ * The PCI configuration space for the NVMe devices is completely
+ * unavailable, so we fake a minimal one and hope for the best.
+ *
+ * Interrupts are shared between the AHCI and NVMe devices. For simplicity,
+ * we only support the legacy interrupt here, although MSI support
+ * could potentially be added later.

+/* BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) congestion control, v2
+ *
+ * BBRv2 is a model-based congestion control algorithm that aims for low
+ * queues, low loss, and (bounded) Reno/CUBIC coexistence. To maintain a model
+ * of the network path, it uses measurements of bandwidth and RTT, as well as
+ * (if they occur) packet loss and/or DCTCP/L4S-style ECN signals.  Note that
+ * although it can use ECN or loss signals explicitly, it does not require
+ * either; it can bound its in-flight data based on its estimate of the BDP.
+ *
+ * The model has both higher and lower bounds for the operating range:
+ *   lo: bw_lo, inflight_lo: conservative short-term lower bound
+ *   hi: bw_hi, inflight_hi: robust long-term upper bound
+ * The bandwidth-probing time scale is (a) extended dynamically based on
+ * estimated BDP to improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC; (b) bounded by
+ * an interactive wall-clock time-scale to be more scalable and responsive
+ * than Reno and CUBIC.
+ *
+ * Here is a state transition diagram for BBR:
+ *
+ *             |
+ *             V
+ *    +---> STARTUP  ----+

+ *    +---- PROBE_RTT <--+
+ *
+ * A BBR flow starts in STARTUP, and ramps up its sending rate quickly.
+ * When it estimates the pipe is full, it enters DRAIN to drain the queue.
+ * In steady state a BBR flow only uses PROBE_BW and PROBE_RTT.
+ * A long-lived BBR flow spends the vast majority of its time remaining
+ * (repeatedly) in PROBE_BW, fully probing and utilizing the pipe's bandwidth
+ * in a fair manner, with a small, bounded queue. *If* a flow has been
+ * continuously sending for the entire min_rtt window, and hasn't seen an RTT
+ * sample that matches or decreases its min_rtt estimate for 10 seconds, then
+ * it briefly enters PROBE_RTT to cut inflight to a minimum value to re-probe
+ * the path's two-way propagation delay (min_rtt). When exiting PROBE_RTT, if
+ * we estimated that we reached the full bw of the pipe then we enter PROBE_BW;
+ * otherwise we enter STARTUP to try to fill the pipe.
+ *
+ * BBR is described in detail in:
+ *   "BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control",
+ *   Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, C. Stephen Gunn, Soheil Hassas Yeganeh,
+ *   Van Jacobson. ACM Queue, Vol. 14 No. 5, September-October 2016.
+ *
+ * There is a public e-mail list for discussing BBR development and testing:
+ *   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bbr-dev
+ *
+ * NOTE: BBR might be used with the fq qdisc ("man tc-fq") with pacing enabled,
+ * otherwise TCP stack falls back to an internal pacing using one high
+ * resolution timer per TCP socket and may use more resources.
