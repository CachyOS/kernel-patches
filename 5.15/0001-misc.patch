+=====
+Brute
+=====
+
+Brute is a Linux Security Module that detects and mitigates fork brute force
+attacks against vulnerable userspace processes.
+
+
+Motivation
+==========
+
+Attacks against vulnerable userspace applications with the purpose to break ASLR
+or bypass canaries traditionally use some level of brute force with the help of
+the fork system call. This is possible since when creating a new process using
+fork its memory contents are the same as those of the parent process (the
+process that called the fork system call). So, the attacker can test the memory
+infinite times to find the correct memory values or the correct memory addresses
+without worrying about crashing the application.
+
+Based on the above scenario it would be nice to have this detected and
+mitigated, and this is the goal of this implementation. Specifically the
+following attacks are expected to be detected:
+
+ 1. Launching (fork()/exec()) a setuid/setgid process repeatedly until a
+    desirable memory layout is got (e.g. Stack Clash).
+ 2. Connecting to an exec()ing network daemon (e.g. xinetd) repeatedly until a
+    desirable memory layout is got (e.g. what CTFs do for simple network
+    service).
+ 3. Launching processes without exec() (e.g. Android Zygote) and exposing state
+    to attack a sibling.
+ 4. Connecting to a fork()ing network daemon (e.g. apache) repeatedly until the
+    previously shared memory layout of all the other children is exposed (e.g.
+    kind of related to HeartBleed).
+
+In each case, a privilege boundary has been crossed:
+
+ | Case 1: setuid/setgid process
+ | Case 2: network to local
+ | Case 3: privilege changes
+ | Case 4: network to local
+
+So, what really needs to be detected are fork/exec brute force attacks that
+cross any of the commented bounds.
+
+
+Other implementations
+=====================
+
+The public version of grsecurity, as a summary, is based on the idea of delaying
+the fork system call if a child died due to some fatal signal (``SIGSEGV``,
+``SIGBUS``, ``SIGKILL`` or ``SIGILL``). This has some issues:
+
+Bad practices
+-------------
+
+Adding delays to the kernel is, in general, a bad idea.
+
+Scenarios not detected (false negatives)
+----------------------------------------
+
+This protection acts only when the fork system call is called after a child has
+crashed. So, it would still be possible for an attacker to fork a big amount of
+children (in the order of thousands), then probe all of them, and finally wait
+the protection time before repeating the steps.
+
+Moreover, this method is based on the idea that the protection doesn't act if
+the parent crashes. So, it would still be possible for an attacker to fork a
+process and probe itself. Then, fork the child process and probe itself again.
+This way, these steps can be repeated infinite times without any mitigation.
+
+Scenarios detected (false positives)
+------------------------------------
+
+Scenarios where an application rarely fails for reasons unrelated to a real
+attack.
+
+
+This implementation
+===================
+
+The main idea behind this implementation is to improve the existing ones
+focusing on the weak points annotated before. Basically, the adopted solution is
+to detect a fast crash rate instead of only one simple crash and to detect both
+the crash of parent and child processes. Also, fine tune the detection focusing
+on privilege boundary crossing. And finally, as a mitigation method, kill all
+the offending tasks involved in the attack and mark the executable as "not
+allowed" (to block the following executions) instead of using delays.
+
+To achieve this goal, and going into more details, this implementation is based
+on the use of some statistical data shared across all the processes that can
+have the same memory contents. Or in other words, a statistical data shared
+between all the fork hierarchy processes after an execve system call.
+
+The purpose of these statistics is, basically, collect all the necessary info to
+compute the application crash period in order to detect an attack. To track all
+this information, the extended attributes (xattr) of the executable files are
+used. More specifically, the name of the attribute is "brute" and uses the
+"security" namespace. So, the full xattr name for the Brute LSM is:
+
+ ``security.brute``
+
+The same can be achieved using a pointer to the fork hierarchy statistical data
+held by the ``task_struct`` structure, but this has an important drawback: a
+brute force attack that happens through the execve system call losts the faults
+info since these statistics are freed when the fork hierarchy disappears. Using
+the last method (pointer in the ``task_struct`` structure) makes not possible to
+manage this attack type that can be successfully treated using extended
+attributes.
+
+To detect a brute force attack it is necessary that the statistics shared by all
+the fork hierarchy processes be updated in every fatal crash and the most
+important data to update is the application crash period.
+
+The crash period is the time between two consecutive faults, but this also has a
+drawback: if an application crashes twice in a short period of time for some
+reason unrelated to a real attack, a false positive will be triggered. To avoid
+this scenario the exponential moving average (EMA) is used. This way, the
+application crash period will be a value that is not prone to change due to
+spurious data and follows the real crash period.
+
+These statistics are stored in the executables using the extended attributes
+feature. So, the detection and mitigation of brute force attacks using this LSM
+it is only feasible in filesystems that support xattr.
+
+.. kernel-doc:: security/brute/brute.c
+   :identifiers: brute_raw_stats
+
+This is a fixed sized struct with a very small footprint. So, in reference to
+memory usage, it is not expected to have problems storing it as an extended
+attribute.
+
+Concerning to access rights to this statistical data, as stated above, the
+"security" namespace is used. Since no custom policy, related to this extended
+attribute, has been implemented for the Brute LSM, all processes have read
+access to these statistics, and write access is limited to processes that have
+the ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` capability.
+
+Attack detection
+----------------
+
+There are two types of brute force attacks that need to be detected. The first
+one is an attack that happens through the fork system call and the second one is
+an attack that happens through the execve system call. Moreover, these two
+attack types have two variants. A slow brute force attack that is detected if a
+maximum number of faults per fork hierarchy is reached and a fast brute force
+attack that is detected if the application crash period falls below a certain
+threshold.
+
+Attack mitigation
+-----------------
+
+Once an attack has been detected, this is mitigated killing all the offending
+tasks involved. Or in other words, once an attack has been detected, this is
+mitigated killing all the processes that are executing the same file that is
+running during the brute force attack. Also, to prevent the executable involved
+in the attack from being respawned by a supervisor, and thus prevent a brute
+force attack from being started again, the file is marked as "not allowed" and
+the following executions are avoided based on this mark. This method allows
+supervisors to implement their own policy: they can read the statistics, know if
+the executable is blocked by the Brute LSM and why, and act based on this
+information. If they want to respawn the offending executable it is only
+necessary to remove the "``security.brute``" extended attribute and thus remove
+the statistical data.
+
+Fine tuning the attack detection
+--------------------------------
+
+To avoid false positives during the attack detection it is necessary to narrow
+the possible cases. To do so, and based on the threat scenarios that we want to
+detect, this implementation also focuses on the crossing of privilege bounds.
+
+To be precise, only the following privilege bounds are taken into account:
+
+ 1. setuid/setgid process
+ 2. network to local
+ 3. privilege changes
+
+Moreover, only the fatal signals delivered by the kernel are taken into account
+avoiding the fatal signals sent by userspace applications (with the exception of
+the ``SIGABRT`` user signal since this is used by glibc for stack canary,
+malloc, etc. failures, which may indicate that a mitigation has been triggered).
+
+Userspace notification via waitid() system call
+-----------------------------------------------
+
+Although the xattr of the executable is accessible from userspace, in complex
+daemons this file may not be visible directly by the supervisor as it may be run
+through some wrapper. So, an extension to the ``waitid()`` system call has been
+added.
+
+ ``int waitid(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, siginfo_t *infop, int options);``
+
+Upon successful return, ``waitid()`` fills in the ``siginfo_t`` structure
+pointed to by ``infop``, but now, the ``si_code`` field can be:
+
+ ``CLD_BRUTE``: child was killed by brute LSM. Defined as value 7.
+
+in addition to the following codes:
+
+ | ``CLD_EXITED``: child has called exit. Defined as value 1.
+ | ``CLD_KILLED``: child was killed by signal. Defined as value 2.
+ | ``CLD_DUMPED``: child terminated abnormally. Defined as value 3.
+ | ``CLD_TRAPPED``: traced child has trapped. Defined as value 4.
+ | ``CLD_STOPPED``: child has stopped. Defined as value 5.
+ | ``CLD_CONTINUED``: stopped child has continued. Defined as value 6.
+
+Exponential moving average (EMA)
+--------------------------------
+
+This kind of average defines a weight (between 0 and 1) for the new value to add
+and applies the remainder of the weight to the current average value. This way,
+some spurious data will not excessively modify the average and only if the new
+values are persistent, the moving average will tend towards them.
+
+Mathematically the application crash period's EMA can be expressed as follows:
+
+ period_ema = period * weight + period_ema * (1 - weight)
+
+Related to the attack detection, the EMA must guarantee that not many crashes
+are needed. To demonstrate this, the scenario where an application has failed
+and then has been running without any crashes for a month, will be used.
+
+The period's EMA can be written now as:
+
+ period_ema[i] = period[i] * weight + period_ema[i - 1] * (1 - weight)
+
+If the new crash periods have insignificant values related to the first crash
+period (a month in this case), the formula can be rewritten as:
+
+ period_ema[i] = period_ema[i - 1] * (1 - weight)
+
+And by extension:
+
+ | period_ema[i - 1] = period_ema[i - 2] * (1 - weight)
+ | period_ema[i - 2] = period_ema[i - 3] * (1 - weight)
+ | period_ema[i - 3] = period_ema[i - 4] * (1 - weight)
+
+So, if the substitution is made:
+
+ | period_ema[i] = period_ema[i - 1] * (1 - weight)
+ | period_ema[i] = period_ema[i - 2] * (1 - weight)\ :sup:`2`
+ | period_ema[i] = period_ema[i - 3] * (1 - weight)\ :sup:`3`
+ | period_ema[i] = period_ema[i - 4] * (1 - weight)\ :sup:`4`
+
+And in a more generic form:
+
+ period_ema[i] = period_ema[i - n] * (1 - weight)\ :sup:`n`
+
+Where "n" represents the number of iterations to obtain an EMA value. Or in
+other words, the number of crashes to detect an attack.
+
+So, if we isolate the number of crashes:
+
+ | period_ema[i] / period_ema[i - n] = (1 - weight)\ :sup:`n`
+ | log(period_ema[i] / period_ema[i - n]) = log((1 - weight)\ :sup:`n`)
+ | log(period_ema[i] / period_ema[i - n]) = n * log(1 - weight)
+ | n = log(period_ema[i] / period_ema[i - n]) / log(1 - weight)
+
+Then, in the commented scenario (an application has failed and then has been
+running without any crashes for a month), the approximate number of crashes to
+detect an attack (using the default implementation values for the weight and the
+crash period threshold) is:
+
+ | weight = 7 / 10
+ | crash_period_threshold = 30 seconds
+
+ | n = log(crash_period_threshold / seconds_per_month) / log(1 - weight)
+ | n = log(30 / (30 * 24 * 3600)) / log(1 - 0.7)
+ | n = 9.44
+
+So, with 10 crashes for this scenario an attack will be detected. If these steps
+are repeated for different scenarios and the results are collected:
+
+ ======================== =====================================
+ time without any crashes number of crashes to detect an attack
+ ======================== =====================================
+ 1 month                  9.44
+ 1 year                   11.50
+ 10 years                 13.42
+ ======================== =====================================
+
+However, this computation has a drawback. The first data added to the EMA not
+obtains a real average showing a trend. So the solution is simple, the EMA needs
+a minimum number of data to be able to be interpreted. This way, the case where
+a few first faults are fast enough followed by no crashes is avoided.
+
+Per system enabling/disabling
+-----------------------------
+
+This feature can be enabled at build time using the
+``CONFIG_SECURITY_FORK_BRUTE`` option or using the visual config application
+under the following menu:
+
+ Security options  ``--->`` Fork brute force attack detection and mitigation
+
+Also, at boot time, this feature can be disable too, by changing the "``lsm=``"
+boot parameter.
+
+Per system configuration
+------------------------
+
+To customize the detection's sensibility there are five new sysctl attributes
+for the Brute LSM that are accessible through the following path:
+
+ ``/proc/sys/kernel/brute/``
+
+More specifically, the files and their description are:
+
+**ema_weight_numerator**
+
+ .. kernel-doc:: security/brute/brute.c
+    :doc: brute_ema_weight_numerator
+
+**ema_weight_denominator**
+
+ .. kernel-doc:: security/brute/brute.c
+    :doc: brute_ema_weight_denominator
+
+**max_faults**
+
+ .. kernel-doc:: security/brute/brute.c
+    :doc: brute_max_faults
+
+**min_faults**
+
+ .. kernel-doc:: security/brute/brute.c
+    :doc: brute_min_faults
+
+**crash_period_threshold**
+
+ .. kernel-doc:: security/brute/brute.c
+    :doc: brute_crash_period_threshold
+
+Kernel selftests
+----------------
+
+To validate all the expectations about this implementation, there is a set of
+selftests. This tests cover fork/exec brute force attacks crossing the following
+privilege boundaries:
+
+ 1. setuid process
+ 2. privilege changes
+ 3. network to local
+
+Also, there are some tests to check that fork/exec brute force attacks without
+crossing any privilege boundary already commented doesn't trigger the detection
+and mitigation stage. Moreover, a test to verify the userspace notification via
+the ``waitid()`` system call has also been added.
+
+To build the tests:
+ ``make -C tools/testing/selftests/ TARGETS=brute``
+
+To run the tests:
+ ``make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=brute run_tests``
+
+To package the tests:
+ ``make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=brute gen_tar``

+	  This is an LSM that stops any fork brute force attack against

+	  the application crash period and as a mitigation procedure all the
+	  offending tasks are killed. Also, the executable file involved in the
+	  attack will be marked as "not allowed" and new execve system calls
+	  using this file will fail. Like capabilities, this security module
+	  stacks with other LSMs. Further information can be found in
