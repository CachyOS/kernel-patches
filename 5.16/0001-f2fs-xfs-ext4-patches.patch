Subject: xfs: shut down filesystem if we xfs_trans_cancel with deferred work
 items

While debugging some very strange rmap corruption reports in connection
with the online directory repair code.  I root-caused the error to the
following incorrect sequence:

<start repair transaction>
<expand directory, causing a deferred rmap to be queued>
<roll transaction>
<cancel transaction>

Obviously, we should have committed the transaction instead of
cancelling it.  Thinking more broadly, however, xfs_trans_cancel should
have warned us that we were throwing away work item that we already
committed to performing.  This is not correct, and we need to shut down
the filesystem.

Change xfs_trans_cancel to complain in the loudest manner if we're
cancelling any transaction with deferred work items attached.

Subject: xfs: fix quotaoff mutex usage now that we don't support disabling it

Prior to commit 40b52225e58c ("xfs: remove support for disabling quota
accounting on a mounted file system"), we used the quotaoff mutex to
protect dquot operations against quotaoff trying to pull down dquots as
part of disabling quota.

Now that we only support turning off quota enforcement, the quotaoff
mutex only protects changes in m_qflags/sb_qflags.  We don't need it to
protect dquots, which means we can remove it from setqlimits and the
dquot scrub code.  While we're at it, fix the function that forces
quotacheck, since it should have been taking the quotaoff mutex.

Subject: xfs: don't expose internal symlink metadata buffers to the vfs

Ian Kent reported that for inline symlinks, it's possible for
vfs_readlink to hang on to the target buffer returned by
_vn_get_link_inline long after it's been freed by xfs inode reclaim.
This is a layering violation -- we should never expose XFS internals to
the VFS.

When the symlink has a remote target, we allocate a separate buffer,
copy the internal information, and let the VFS manage the new buffer's
lifetime.  Let's adapt the inline code paths to do this too.  It's
less efficient, but fixes the layering violation and avoids the need to
adapt the if_data lifetime to rcu rules.  Clearly I don't care about
readlink benchmarks.

As a side note, this fixes the minor locking violation where we can
access the inode data fork without taking any locks; proper locking (and
eliminating the possibility of having to switch inode_operations on a
live inode) is essential to online repair coordinating repairs
correctly.

Subject: xfs: only run COW extent recovery when there are no live extents

As part of multiple customer escalations due to file data corruption
after copy on write operations, I wrote some fstests that use fsstress
to hammer on COW to shake things loose.  Regrettably, I caught some
filesystem shutdowns due to incorrect rmap operations with the following
loop:

mount <filesystem>				# (0)
fsstress <run only readonly ops> &		# (1)
while true; do
	fsstress <run all ops>
	mount -o remount,ro			# (2)
	fsstress <run only readonly ops>
	mount -o remount,rw			# (3)
done

When (2) happens, notice that (1) is still running.  xfs_remount_ro will
call xfs_blockgc_stop to walk the inode cache to free all the COW
extents, but the blockgc mechanism races with (1)'s reader threads to
take IOLOCKs and loses, which means that it doesn't clean them all out.
Call such a file (A).

When (3) happens, xfs_remount_rw calls xfs_reflink_recover_cow, which
walks the ondisk refcount btree and frees any COW extent that it finds.
This function does not check the inode cache, which means that incore
COW forks of inode (A) is now inconsistent with the ondisk metadata.  If
one of those former COW extents are allocated and mapped into another
file (B) and someone triggers a COW to the stale reservation in (A), A's
dirty data will be written into (B) and once that's done, those blocks
will be transferred to (A)'s data fork without bumping the refcount.

The results are catastrophic -- file (B) and the refcount btree are now
corrupt.  In the first patch, we fixed the race condition in (2) so that
(A) will always flush the COW fork.  In this second patch, we move the
_recover_cow call to the initial mount call in (0) for safety.

As mentioned previously, xfs_reflink_recover_cow walks the refcount
btree looking for COW staging extents, and frees them.  This was
intended to be run at mount time (when we know there are no live inodes)
to clean up any leftover staging events that may have been left behind
during an unclean shutdown.  As a time "optimization" for readonly
mounts, we deferred this to the ro->rw transition, not realizing that
any failure to clean all COW forks during a rw->ro transition would
result in catastrophic corruption.

Therefore, remove this optimization and only run the recovery routine
when we're guaranteed not to have any COW staging extents anywhere,
which means we always run this at mount time.  While we're at it, move
the callsite to xfs_log_mount_finish because any refcount btree
expansion (however unlikely given that we're removing records from the
right side of the index) must be fed by a per-AG reservation, which
doesn't exist in its current location.

Subject: xfs: fix a bug in the online fsck directory leaf1 bestcount check

When xfs_scrub encounters a directory with a leaf1 block, it tries to
validate that the leaf1 block's bestcount (aka the best free count of
each directory data block) is the correct size.  Previously, this author
believed that comparing bestcount to the directory isize (since
directory data blocks are under isize, and leaf/bestfree blocks are
above it) was sufficient.

Unfortunately during testing of online repair, it was discovered that it
is possible to create a directory with a hole between the last directory
block and isize.  The directory code seems to handle this situation just
fine and xfs_repair doesn't complain, which effectively makes this quirk
part of the disk format.

Fix the check to work properly.

Subject: xfs: check sb_meta_uuid for dabuf buffer recovery

Got a report that a repeated crash test of a container host would
eventually fail with a log recovery error preventing the system from
mounting the root filesystem. It manifested as a directory leaf node
corruption on writeback like so:

 XFS (loop0): log mount/recovery failed: error -117
 XFS (loop0): log mount failed

Tracing indicated that we were recovering changes from a transaction
at LSN 0x29/0x1c16 into a buffer that had an LSN of 0x29/0x1d57.
That is, log recovery was overwriting a buffer with newer changes on
disk than was in the transaction. Tracing indicated that we were
hitting the "recovery immediately" case in
xfs_buf_log_recovery_lsn(), and hence it was ignoring the LSN in the
buffer.

The code was extracting the LSN correctly, then ignoring it because
the UUID in the buffer did not match the superblock UUID. The
problem arises because the UUID check uses the wrong UUID - it
should be checking the sb_meta_uuid, not sb_uuid. This filesystem
has sb_uuid != sb_meta_uuid (which is fine), and the buffer has the
correct matching sb_meta_uuid in it, it's just the code checked it
against the wrong superblock uuid.

The is no corruption in the filesystem, and failing to recover the
buffer due to a write verifier failure means the recovery bug did
not propagate the corruption to disk. Hence there is no corruption
before or after this bug has manifested, the impact is limited
simply to an unmountable filesystem....

This was missed back in 2015 during an audit of incorrect sb_uuid
usage that resulted in commit fcfbe2c4ef42 ("xfs: log recovery needs
to validate against sb_meta_uuid") that fixed the magic32 buffers to
validate against sb_meta_uuid instead of sb_uuid. It missed the
magicda buffers....

Subject: xfs: prevent a WARN_ONCE() in xfs_ioc_attr_list()

The "bufsize" comes from the root user.  If "bufsize" is negative then,
because of type promotion, neither of the validation checks at the start
of the function are able to catch it:

	if (bufsize < sizeof(struct xfs_attrlist) ||
	    bufsize > XFS_XATTR_LIST_MAX)
		return -EINVAL;

This means "bufsize" will trigger (WARN_ON_ONCE(size > INT_MAX)) in
kvmalloc_node().  Fix this by changing the type from int to size_t.

Subject: xfs: prevent UAF in xfs_log_item_in_current_chkpt

While I was running with KASAN and lockdep enabled, I stumbled upon an
KASAN report about a UAF to a freed CIL checkpoint.  Looking at the
comment for xfs_log_item_in_current_chkpt, it seems pretty obvious to me
that the original patch to xfs_defer_finish_noroll should have done
something to lock the CIL to prevent it from switching the CIL contexts
while the predicate runs.

For upper level code that needs to know if a given log item is new
enough not to need relogging, add a new wrapper that takes the CIL
context lock long enough to sample the current CIL context.  This is
kind of racy in that the CIL can switch the contexts immediately after
sampling, but that's ok because the consequence is that the defer ops
code is a little slow to relog items.

Subject: xfs: sysfs: use default_groups in kobj_type

There are currently 2 ways to create a set of sysfs files for a
kobj_type, through the default_attrs field, and the default_groups
field.  Move the xfs sysfs code to use default_groups field which has
been the preferred way since aa30f47cf666 ("kobject: Add support for
default attribute groups to kobj_type") so that we can soon get rid of
the obsolete default_attrs field.

Subject: xfs: reduce kvmalloc overhead for CIL shadow buffers

Oh, let me count the ways that the kvmalloc API sucks dog eggs.

The problem is when we are logging lots of large objects, we hit
kvmalloc really damn hard with costly order allocations, and
behaviour utterly sucks:

     - 49.73% xlog_cil_commit

	 - 2.22% kvfree

On this workload, that's almost a dozen CPUs all trying to compact
and reclaim memory inside kvmalloc_node at the same time. Yet it is
regularly falling back to vmalloc despite all that compaction, page
and shrinker reclaim that direct reclaim is doing. Copying all the
metadata is taking far less CPU time than allocating the storage!

Direct reclaim should be considered extremely harmful.

This is a high frequency, high throughput, CPU usage and latency
sensitive allocation. We've got memory there, and we're using
kvmalloc to allow memory allocation to avoid doing lots of work to
try to do contiguous allocations.

Except it still does *lots of costly work* that is unnecessary.

Worse: the only way to avoid the slowpath page allocation trying to
do compaction on costly allocations is to turn off direct reclaim
(i.e. remove __GFP_RECLAIM_DIRECT from the gfp flags).

Unfortunately, the stupid kvmalloc API then says "oh, this isn't a
GFP_KERNEL allocation context, so you only get kmalloc!". This
cuts off the vmalloc fallback, and this leads to almost instant OOM
problems which ends up in filesystems deadlocks, shutdowns and/or
kernel crashes.

I want some basic kvmalloc behaviour:

- kmalloc for a contiguous range with fail fast semantics - no
  compaction direct reclaim if the allocation enters the slow path.
- run normal vmalloc (i.e. GFP_KERNEL) if kmalloc fails

The really, really stupid part about this is these kvmalloc() calls
are run under memalloc_nofs task context, so all the allocations are
always reduced to GFP_NOFS regardless of the fact that kvmalloc
requires GFP_KERNEL to be passed in. IOWs, we're already telling
kvmalloc to behave differently to the gfp flags we pass in, but it
still won't allow vmalloc to be run with anything other than
GFP_KERNEL.

So, this patch open codes the kvmalloc() in the commit path to have
the above described behaviour. The result is we more than halve the
CPU time spend doing kvmalloc() in this path and transaction commits
with 64kB objects in them more than doubles. i.e. we get ~5x
reduction in CPU usage per costly-sized kvmalloc() invocation and
the profile looks like this:

  - 37.60% xlog_cil_commit
	16.01% memcpy_erms
      - 8.45% __kmalloc
	 - 8.04% kmalloc_order_trace
	    - 8.03% kmalloc_order
	       - 7.93% alloc_pages
		  - 7.90% __alloc_pages
		     - 4.05% __alloc_pages_slowpath.constprop.0
			- 2.18% get_page_from_freelist
			- 1.77% wake_all_kswapds
....
				    - __wake_up_common_lock
				       - 0.94% _raw_spin_lock_irqsave
		     - 3.72% get_page_from_freelist
			- 2.43% _raw_spin_lock_irqsave
      - 5.72% vmalloc
	 - 5.72% __vmalloc_node_range
	    - 4.81% __get_vm_area_node.constprop.0
	       - 3.26% alloc_vmap_area
		  - 2.52% _raw_spin_lock
	       - 1.46% _raw_spin_lock
	      0.56% __alloc_pages_bulk
      - 4.66% kvfree
	 - 3.25% vfree
	    - __vfree
	       - 3.23% __vunmap
		  - 1.95% remove_vm_area
		     - 1.06% free_vmap_area_noflush
			- 0.82% _raw_spin_lock
		     - 0.68% _raw_spin_lock
		  - 0.92% _raw_spin_lock
	 - 1.40% kfree
	    - 1.36% __free_pages
	       - 1.35% __free_pages_ok
		  - 1.02% _raw_spin_lock_irqsave

It's worth noting that over 50% of the CPU time spent allocating
these shadow buffers is now spent on spinlocks. So the shadow buffer
allocation overhead is greatly reduced by getting rid of direct
reclaim from kmalloc, and could probably be made even less costly if
vmalloc() didn't use global spinlocks to protect it's structures.

Subject: xfs: hold quota inode ILOCK_EXCL until the end of dqalloc

Online fsck depends on callers holding ILOCK_EXCL from the time they
decide to update a block mapping until after they've updated the reverse
mapping records to guarantee the stability of both mapping records.
Unfortunately, the quota code drops ILOCK_EXCL at the first transaction
roll in the dquot allocation process, which breaks that assertion.  This
leads to sporadic failures in the online rmap repair code if the repair
code grabs the AGF after bmapi_write maps a new block into the quota
file's data fork but before it can finish the deferred rmap update.

Fix this by rewriting the function to hold the ILOCK until after the
transaction commit like all other bmap updates do, and get rid of the
dqread wrapper that does nothing but complicate the codebase.

From da812f611934bef16fe02d667a76df77ae9cf99a Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Lukas Czerner <lczerner@redhat.com>
Date: Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:18:49 +0200
Subject: ext4: Allow sb to be NULL in ext4_msg()

At the parsing phase of mount in the new mount api sb will not be
available so allow sb to be NULL in ext4_msg and use that in
handle_mount_opt().

Also change return value to appropriate -EINVAL where needed.

Subject: ext4: move quota configuration out of handle_mount_opt()

At the parsing phase of mount in the new mount api sb will not be
available so move quota confiquration out of handle_mount_opt() by
noting the quota file names in the ext4_fs_context structure to be
able to apply it later.

Subject: ext4: check ext2/3 compatibility outside handle_mount_opt()

At the parsing phase of mount in the new mount api sb will not be
available so move ext2/3 compatibility check outside handle_mount_opt().
Unfortunately we will lose the ability to show exactly which option is
not compatible.

From 6e47a3cc68fc525428297a00524833361ebbb0e9 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

Subject: ext4: get rid of super block and sbi from handle_mount_ops()

At the parsing phase of mount in the new mount api sb will not be
available. We've already removed some uses of sb and sbi, but now we
need to get rid of the rest of it.

Use ext4_fs_context to store all of the configuration specification so
that it can be later applied to the super block and sbi.

From 7edfd85b1ffd36593011dec96ab395912a340418 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Lukas Czerner <lczerner@redhat.com>

Subject: ext4: Completely separate options parsing and sb setup

The new mount api separates option parsing and super block setup into
two distinct steps and so we need to separate the options parsing out of
the ext4_fill_super() and ext4_remount().

In order to achieve this we have to create new ext4_fill_super() and
ext4_remount() functions which will serve its purpose only until we
actually do convert to the new api (as such they are only temporary for
this patch series) and move the option parsing out of the old function
which will now be renamed to __ext4_fill_super() and __ext4_remount().

There is a small complication in the fact that while the mount option
parsing is going to happen before we get to __ext4_fill_super(), the
mount options stored in the super block itself needs to be applied
first, before the user specified mount options.

So with this patch we're going through the following sequence:

- parse user provided options (including sb block)
- initialize sbi and store s_sb_block if provided
- in __ext4_fill_super()
	- read the super block
	- parse and apply options specified in s_mount_opts
	- check and apply user provided options stored in ctx
	- continue with the regular ext4_fill_super operation

It's not exactly the most elegant solution, but if we still want to
support s_mount_opts we have to do it in this order.

Subject: ext4: clean up return values in handle_mount_opt()

Clean up return values in handle_mount_opt() and rename the function to
ext4_parse_param()

Now we can use it in fs_context_operations as .parse_param.

Subject: ext4: change token2str() to use ext4_param_specs

Change token2str() to use ext4_param_specs instead of tokens so that we
can get rid of tokens entirely.

Subject: ext4: switch to the new mount api

Add the necessary functions for the fs_context_operations. Convert and
rename ext4_remount() and ext4_fill_super() to ext4_get_tree() and
ext4_reconfigure() respectively and switch the ext4 to use the new api.

One user facing change is the fact that we no longer have access to the
entire string of mount options provided by mount(2) since the mount api
does not store it anywhere. As a result we can't print the options to
the log as we did in the past after the successful mount.

Subject: ext4: Remove unused match_table_t tokens

Remove unused match_table_t, slim down mount_opts structure by removing
unnecessary definitions, remove redundant MOPT_ flags and clean up
ext4_parse_param() by converting the most of the if/else branching to
switch except for the MOPT_SET/MOPT_CEAR handling.

From 4c2467287779f744cdd70c8ec70903034d6584f0 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Lukas Czerner <lczerner@redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:26:57 +0100
Subject: ext4: don't fail remount if journalling mode didn't change

Switching to the new mount api introduced inconsistency in how the
journalling mode mount option (data=) is handled during a remount.

Ext4 always prevented changing the journalling mode during the remount,
however the new code always fails the remount when the journalling mode
is specified, even if it remains unchanged. Fix it.

Subject: ext4: remove lazytime/nolazytime mount options handled by MS_LAZYTIME

The lazytime and nolazytime mount options were added temporarily back in
2015 with commit a26f49926da9 ("ext4: add optimization for the lazytime
mount option"). It think it has been enough time for the util-linux with
lazytime support to get widely used. Remove the mount options.

Subject: ext4: fix i_version handling on remount

i_version mount option is getting lost on remount. This is because the
'i_version' mount option differs from the util-linux mount option
'iversion', but it has exactly the same functionality. We have to
specifically notify the vfs that this is what we want by setting
appropriate flag in fc->sb_flags. Fix it and as a result we can remove
*flags argument from __ext4_remount(); do the same for
__ext4_fill_super().

In addition set out to deprecate ext4 specific 'i_version' mount option
in favor or 'iversion' by kernel version 5.20.

Subject: ext4: use ext4_journal_start/stop for fast commit transactions

This patch drops all calls to ext4_fc_start_update() and
ext4_fc_stop_update(). To ensure that there are no ongoing journal
updates during fast commit, we also make jbd2_fc_begin_commit() lock
journal for updates. This way we don't have to maintain two different
transaction start stop APIs for fast commit and full commit. This
patch doesn't remove the functions altogether since in future we want
to have inode level locking for fast commits.

  * Fast Commit Ineligibility
  * -------------------------
- * Not all operations are supported by fast commits today (e.g extended
- * attributes). Fast commit ineligibility is marked by calling one of the
- * two following functions:
- *
- * - ext4_fc_mark_ineligible(): This makes next fast commit operation to fall
- *   back to full commit. This is useful in case of transient errors.
  *
- * - ext4_fc_start_ineligible() and ext4_fc_stop_ineligible() - This makes all
- *   the fast commits happening between ext4_fc_start_ineligible() and
- *   ext4_fc_stop_ineligible() and one fast commit after the call to
- *   ext4_fc_stop_ineligible() to fall back to full commits. It is important to
- *   make one more fast commit to fall back to full commit after stop call so
- *   that it guaranteed that the fast commit ineligible operation contained
- *   within ext4_fc_start_ineligible() and ext4_fc_stop_ineligible() is
- *   followed by at least 1 full commit.

Subject: ext4: simplify updating of fast commit stats

Move fast commit stats updating logic to a separate function from
ext4_fc_commit(). This significantly improves readability of
ext4_fc_commit().

Subject: ext4: fix fast commit may miss tracking range for
 FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE

when call falloc with FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE, to set an range to unwritten,
which has been already initialized. If the range is align to blocksize,
fast commit will not track range for this change.

Also track range for unwritten range in ext4_map_blocks().

Subject: ext4: use ext4_ext_remove_space() for fast commit replay delete range

For now ,we use ext4_punch_hole() during fast commit replay delete range
procedure. But it will be affected by inode->i_size, which may not
correct during fast commit replay procedure. The following test will
failed.

-create & write foo (len 1000K)
-falloc FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE foo (range 400K - 600K)
-create & fsync bar
-falloc FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE foo (range 300K-500K)
-fsync foo
-crash before a full commit

After the fast_commit reply procedure, the range 400K-500K will not be
removed. Because in this case, when calling ext4_punch_hole() the
inode->i_size is 0, and it just retruns with doing nothing.

Change to use ext4_ext_remove_space() instead of ext4_punch_hole()
to remove blocks of inode directly.

If use FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE to alloc unwritten range at bottom, the
inode->i_size will not include the unwritten range. When call
ftruncate with fast commit enabled, it will miss to track the
unwritten range.

Change to trace the full range during ftruncate.

In order to reproduce this problem, the following conditions need to be met:
1. Ext4 filesystem with no journal;
2. Filesystem image with incorrect quota data;
3. Abort filesystem forced by user;
4. umount filesystem;

As in ext4_quota_write:
...
         if (EXT4_SB(sb)->s_journal && !handle) {
                 ext4_msg(sb, KERN_WARNING, "Quota write (off=%llu, len=%llu)"
                         " cancelled because transaction is not started",
                         (unsigned long long)off, (unsigned long long)len);
                 return -EIO;
         }
...
We only check handle if NULL when filesystem has journal. There is need
check handle if NULL even when filesystem has no journal.

Subject: ext4: make sure quota gets properly shutdown on error

When we hit an error when enabling quotas and setting inode flags, we do
not properly shutdown quota subsystem despite returning error from
Q_QUOTAON quotactl. This can lead to some odd situations like kernel
using quota file while it is still writeable for userspace. Make sure we
properly cleanup the quota subsystem in case of error.

Subject: ext4: make sure to reset inode lockdep class when quota enabling
 fails

When we succeed in enabling some quota type but fail to enable another
one with quota feature, we correctly disable all enabled quota types.
However we forget to reset i_data_sem lockdep class. When the inode gets
freed and reused, it will inherit this lockdep class (i_data_sem is
initialized only when a slab is created) and thus eventually lockdep
barfs about possible deadlocks.

Subject: ext4: fix a possible ABBA deadlock due to busy PA

We found on older kernel (3.10) that in the scenario of insufficient
disk space, system may trigger an ABBA deadlock problem, it seems that
this problem still exists in latest kernel, try to fix it here. The
main process triggered by this problem is that task A occupies the PA
and waits for the jbd2 transaction finish, the jbd2 transaction waits
for the completion of task B's IO (plug_list), but task B waits for
the release of PA by task A to finish discard, which indirectly forms
an ABBA deadlock. The related calltrace is as follows:

    Task A
    vfs_write
    ext4_mb_new_blocks()
    ext4_mb_mark_diskspace_used()       JBD2
    jbd2_journal_get_write_access()  -> jbd2_journal_commit_transaction()
  ->schedule()                          filemap_fdatawait()
 |                                              |
 | Task B                                       |
 | do_unlinkat()                                |
 | ext4_evict_inode()                           |
 | jbd2_journal_begin_ordered_truncate()        |
 | filemap_fdatawrite_range()                   |
 | ext4_mb_new_blocks()                         |
  -ext4_mb_discard_group_preallocations() <-----

Here, try to cancel ext4_mb_discard_group_preallocations() internal
retry due to PA busy, and do a limited number of retries inside
ext4_mb_discard_preallocations(), which can circumvent the above
problems, but also has some advantages:

1. Since the PA is in a busy state, if other groups have free PAs,
   keeping the current PA may help to reduce fragmentation.
2. Continue to traverse forward instead of waiting for the current
   group PA to be released. In most scenarios, the PA discard time
   can be reduced.

However, in the case of smaller free space, if only a few groups have
space, then due to multiple traversals of the group, it may increase
CPU overhead. But in contrast, I feel that the overall benefit is
better than the cost.

It is not guaranteed that __ext4_get_inode_loc will definitely set
err_blk pointer when it returns EIO. To avoid using uninitialized
variables, let's first set err_blk to 0.

Now, indirect truncate process didn't handle error. To solve this issue
maybe simply add check handle is abort in '__ext4_journal_ensure_credits'
is enough, and i also think this is necessary.

Subject: ext4: fix an use-after-free issue about data=journal writeback mode

Our syzkaller report an use-after-free issue that accessing the freed
buffer_head on the writeback page in __ext4_journalled_writepage(). The
problem is that if there was a truncate racing with the data=journalled
writeback procedure, the writeback length could become zero and
bget_one() refuse to get buffer_head's refcount, then the truncate
procedure release buffer once we drop page lock, finally, the last
ext4_walk_page_buffers() trigger the use-after-free problem.

sync                               truncate
ext4_sync_file()
 file_write_and_wait_range()
                                   ext4_setattr(0)
                                    inode->i_size = 0
  ext4_writepage()
   len = 0
   __ext4_journalled_writepage()
    page_bufs = page_buffers(page)
    ext4_walk_page_buffers(bget_one) <- does not get refcount
                                    do_invalidatepage()
                                      free_buffer_head()
    ext4_walk_page_buffers(page_bufs) <- trigger use-after-free

After commit bdf96838aea6 ("ext4: fix race between truncate and
__ext4_journalled_writepage()"), we have already handled the racing
case, so the bget_one() and bput_one() are not needed. So this patch
simply remove these hunk, and recheck the i_size to make it safe.

Subject: ext4: avoid trim error on fs with small groups

A user reported FITRIM ioctl failing for him on ext4 on some devices
without apparent reason.  After some debugging we've found out that
these devices (being LVM volumes) report rather large discard
granularity of 42MB and the filesystem had 1k blocksize and thus group
size of 8MB. Because ext4 FITRIM implementation puts discard
granularity into minlen, ext4_trim_fs() declared the trim request as
invalid. However just silently doing nothing seems to be a more
appropriate reaction to such combination of parameters since user did
not specify anything wrong.

Subject: ext4: don't use kfree() on rcu protected pointer sbi->s_qf_names

During ext4 mount api rework the commit e6e268cb6822 ("ext4: move quota
configuration out of handle_mount_opt()") introduced a bug where we
would kfree(sbi->s_qf_names[i]) before assigning the new quota name in
ext4_apply_quota_options().

This is wrong because we're using kfree() on rcu prointer that could be
simultaneously accessed from ext4_show_quota_options() during remount.
Fix it by using rcu_replace_pointer() to replace the old qname with the
new one and then kfree_rcu() the old quota name.

Also use get_qf_name() instead of sbi->s_qf_names in strcmp() to silence
the sparse warning.

Subject: ext4: implement support for get/set fs label

Implement support for FS_IOC_GETFSLABEL and FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL ioctls for
online reading and setting of file system label.

ext4_ioctl_getlabel() is simple, just get the label from the primary
superblock. This might not be the first sb on the file system if
'sb=' mount option is used.

In ext4_ioctl_setlabel() we update what ext4 currently views as a
primary superblock and then proceed to update backup superblocks. There
are two caveats:
 - the primary superblock might not be the first superblock and so it
   might not be the one used by userspace tools if read directly
   off the disk.
 - because the primary superblock might not be the first superblock we
   potentialy have to update it as part of backup superblock update.
   However the first sb location is a bit more complicated than the rest
   so we have to account for that.

The superblock modification is created generic enough so the
infrastructure can be used for other potential superblock modification
operations, such as chaning UUID.

Tested with generic/492 with various configurations. I also checked the
behavior with 'sb=' mount options, including very large file systems
with and without sparse_super/sparse_super2.

Subject: ext4: change s_last_trim_minblks type to unsigned long

There is no good reason for the s_last_trim_minblks to be atomic. There is
no data integrity needed and there is no real danger in setting and
reading it in a racy manner. Change it to be unsigned long, the same type
as s_clusters_per_group which is the maximum that's allowed.

Subject: ext4: allow to change s_last_trim_minblks via sysfs

Ext4 has an optimization mechanism for batched disacrd (FITRIM) that
should help speed up subsequent calls of FITRIM ioctl by skipping the
groups that were previously trimmed. However because the FITRIM allows
to set the minimum size of an extent to trim, ext4 stores the last
minimum extent size and only avoids trimming the group if it was
previously trimmed with minimum extent size equal to, or smaller than
the current call.

There is currently no way to bypass the optimization without
umount/mount cycle. This becomes a problem when the file system is
live migrated to a different storage, because the optimization will
prevent possibly useful discard calls to the storage.

Fix it by exporting the s_last_trim_minblks via sysfs interface which
will allow us to set the minimum size to the number of blocks larger
than subsequent FITRIM call, effectively bypassing the optimization.

By setting the s_last_trim_minblks to ULONG_MAX the optimization will be
effectively cleared regardless of the previous state, or file system
configuration.

For example:
getconf ULONG_MAX > /sys/fs/ext4/dm-1/last_trim_minblks

MIME-Version: 1.0

When migrating to extents, the temporary inode will have it's own checksum
seed.  This means that, when swapping the inodes data, the inode checksums
will be incorrect.

This can be fixed by recalculating the extents checksums again.  Or simply
by copying the seed into the temporary inode.

Subject: ext4: fix a copy and paste typo

This was obviously supposed to be an ext4 struct, not xfs.  GCC
doesn't care either way so it doesn't affect the build or runtime.

BUG_ON would be better.

Subject: ext4: don't use the orphan list when migrating an inode

We probably want to remove the indirect block to extents migration
feature after a deprecation window, but until then, let's fix a
potential data loss problem caused by the fact that we put the
tmp_inode on the orphan list.  In the unlikely case where we crash and
do a journal recovery, the data blocks belonging to the inode being
migrated are also represented in the tmp_inode on the orphan list ---
and so its data blocks will get marked unallocated, and available for
reuse.

Instead, stop putting the tmp_inode on the oprhan list.  So in the
case where we crash while migrating the inode, we'll leak an inode,
which is not a disaster.  It will be easily fixed the next time we run
fsck, and it's better than potentially having blocks getting claimed
by two different files, and losing data as a result.
