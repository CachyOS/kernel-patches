+=================================
+Block Device (blkdev) LED Trigger
+=================================
+
+Available when ``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV=y`` or
+``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV=m``.
+
+See also:
+
+* ``Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-trigger-blkdev``
+* ``Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-block`` (``/sys/block/<disk>/linked_leds``)
+
+Overview
+========
+
+.. note::
+	The examples below use ``<LED>`` to refer to the name of a
+	system-specific LED.  If no suitable LED is available on a test
+	system (in a virtual machine, for example), it is possible to
+	use a userspace LED.  (See ``Documentation/leds/uleds.rst``.)
+
+Verify that the ``blkdev`` LED trigger is available::
+
+	# grep blkdev /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+	... rfkill-none blkdev
+
+(If the previous command produces no output, you may need to load the trigger
+module - ``modprobe ledtrig_blkdev``.  If the module is not available, check
+the value of ``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV`` in your kernel configuration.)
+
+Associate the LED with the ``blkdev`` LED trigger::
+
+	# echo blkdev > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+
+	# cat /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
+	... rfkill-none [blkdev]
+
+Note that several new device attributes are available in the
+``/sys/class/leds/<LED>`` directory.
+
+* ``link_dev_by_path``, ``unlink_dev_by_path``, and ``unlink_dev_by_name`` are
+  used to manage the set of block devices associated with this LED.  The LED
+  will blink when activity occurs on any of its linked devices.
+
+* ``blink_on_read``, ``blink_on_write``, ``blink_on_discard``, and
+  ``blink_on_flush`` are boolean values that determine whether the LED will
+  blink when a particular type of activity is detected on one of its linked
+  block devices.
+
+* ``blink_time`` is the duration (in milliseconds) of each blink of this LED.
+  (The minimum value is 10 milliseconds.)
+
+* ``check_interval`` is the frequency (in milliseconds) with which block devices
+  linked to this LED will be checked for activity and the LED blinked (if the
+  correct type of activity has occurred).
+
+* The ``linked_devices`` directory will contain a symbolic link to every device
+  that is associated with this LED.
+
+Link a block device to the LED::
+
+	# echo /dev/sda > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_dev_by_path
+
+	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
+	sda
+
+(The value written to ``link_dev_by_path`` must be the path of the device
+special file, such as ``/dev/sda``, that represents the block device - or the
+path of a symbolic link to such a device special file.)
+
+Activity on the device will now cause the LED to blink.  The duration of each
+blink (in milliseconds) can be adjusted by setting
+``/sys/class/leds/<LED>/blink_time``.  (But see **check_interval and
+blink_time** below.)
+
+Associate a second device with the LED::
+
+	# echo /dev/sdb > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_dev_by_path
+
+	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
+	sda  sdb
+
+When a block device is linked to one or more LEDs, the LEDs are linked from
+the device's ``linked_leds`` directory::
+
+	# ls /sys/class/block/sd{a,b}/linked_leds
+	/sys/class/block/sda/linked_leds:
+	<LED>
+
+	/sys/class/block/sdb/linked_leds:
+	<LED>
+
+(The ``linked_leds`` directory only exists when the block device is linked to
+at least one LED.)
+
+``check_interval`` and ``blink_time``
+=====================================
+
+* By default, linked block devices are checked for activity every 100
+  milliseconds.  This frequency can be changed for an LED via the
+  ``/sys/class/leds/<led>/check_interval`` attribute.  (The minimum value is 25
+  milliseconds.)
+
+* All block devices associated with an LED are checked for activity every
+  ``check_interval`` milliseconds, and a blink is triggered if the correct type
+  of activity (as determined by the LED's ``blink_on_*`` attributes) is
+  detected.  The duration of an LED's blink is determined by its ``blink_time``
+  attribute.  Thus (when the correct type of activity is detected), the LED will
+  be on for ``blink_time`` milliseconds and off for
+  ``check_interval - blink_time`` milliseconds.
+
+* The LED subsystem ignores new blink requests for an LED that is already in
+  in the process of blinking, so setting a ``blink_time`` greater than or equal
+  to ``check_interval`` will cause some blinks to be missed.
+
+* Because of processing times, scheduling latencies, etc., avoiding missed
+  blinks actually requires a difference of at least a few milliseconds between
+  the ``blink_time`` and ``check_interval``.  The required difference is likely
+  to vary from system to system.  As a  reference, a Thecus N5550 NAS requires a
+  difference of 7 milliseconds (e.g. ``check_interval == 100``,
+  ``blink_time == 93``).
+
+* The default values (``check_interval == 100``, ``blink_time == 75``) cause the
+  LED associated with a continuously active device to blink rapidly.  For a more
+  "always on" effect, increase the ``blink_time`` (but not too much; see the
+  previous bullet).
+
+Other Notes
+===========
+
+* Many (possibly all) types of block devices work with this trigger, including:
+
+  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) hard disk drives and SSDs
+  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) optical drives
+  * NVMe SSDs
+  * SD cards
+  * loopback block devices (``/dev/loop*``)
+  * device mapper devices, such as LVM logical volumes
+  * MD RAID devices
+  * zRAM compressed RAM-disks
+  * partitions on block devices that support them
+
+* The names of the symbolic links in ``/sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices``
+  are **kernel** names, which may not match the paths used for
+  ``link_dev_by_path`` and ``unlink_dev_by_path``.  This is most likely when a
+  symbolic link is used to refer to the device (as is common with logical
+  volumes), but it can be true for any device, because nothing prevents the
+  creation of device special files with arbitrary names (e.g.
+  ``sudo mknod /foo b 8 0``).
+
+  Kernel names can be used to unlink block devices from LEDs by writing them to
+  the LED's ``unlink_dev_by_name`` attribute.
+
+* The ``blkdev`` LED trigger supports many-to-many device/LED associations.
+  A device can be associated with multiple LEDs, and an LED can be associated
+  with multiple devices.

+/**
+ * DOC: Overview
+ *
+ * The ``blkdev`` LED trigger works by periodically checking the activity
+ * counters of block devices that have been linked to one or more LEDs and
+ * blinking those LED(s) if the correct type of activity has occurred.  The
+ * periodic check is scheduled with the Linux kernel's deferred work facility.
+ *
+ * Trigger-specific data about block devices and LEDs is stored in two data
+ * structures --- &struct blkdev_trig_bdev (a "BTB") and &struct blkdev_trig_led
+ * (a "BTL").  Each structure contains a &struct xarray that holds links to any
+ * linked devices of the other type.  I.e. &blkdev_trig_bdev.linked_btls
+ * contains links to all BTLs whose LEDs have been linked to the BTB's block
+ * device, and &blkdev_trig_led.linked_btbs contains links to all BTBs whose
+ * block devices have been linked to the BTL's LED.  Thus, a block device can
+ * be linked to more than one LED, and an LED can be linked to more than one
+ * block device.
