Subject: [PATCH 09/16] cpufreq: acpi: move MSR_K7_HWCR_CPB_DIS_BIT into
 msr-index.h

There are some other drivers also need to use the
MSR_K7_HWCR_CPB_DIS_BIT for CPB control bit, so it makes sense to move
the definition to a common header file to allow other driver to use it.

No intentional functional impact.
