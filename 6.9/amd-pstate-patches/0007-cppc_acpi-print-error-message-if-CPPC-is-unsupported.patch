Subject: [PATCH 07/16] cppc_acpi: print error message if CPPC is unsupported

The amd-pstate driver can fail when _CPC objects are not supported by
the CPU. However, the current error message is ambiguous (see below) and
there is no clear way for attributing the failure of the amd-pstate
driver to the lack of CPPC support.

[    0.477523] amd_pstate: the _CPC object is not present in SBIOS or ACPI disabled

Fix this by adding an debug message to notify the user if the amd-pstate
driver failed to load due to CPPC not be supported by the CPU
