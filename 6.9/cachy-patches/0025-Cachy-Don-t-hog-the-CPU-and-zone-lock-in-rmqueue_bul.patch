Subject: [PATCH 25/25] Cachy: Don't hog the CPU and zone lock in
 rmqueue_bulk()

There is noticeable scheduling latency and heavy zone lock contention
stemming from rmqueue_bulk's single hold of the zone lock while doing
its work, as seen with the preemptoff tracer. There's no actual need for
rmqueue_bulk() to hold the zone lock the entire time; it only does so
for supposed efficiency. As such, we can relax the zone lock and even
reschedule when IRQs are enabled in order to keep the scheduling delays
and zone lock contention at bay. Forward progress is still guaranteed,
as the zone lock can only be relaxed after page removal.

With this change, rmqueue_bulk() no longer appears as a serious offender
in the preemptoff tracer, and system latency is noticeably improved.
