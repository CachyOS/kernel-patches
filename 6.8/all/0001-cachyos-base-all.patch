+// This file implements AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for x86_64 CPUs that
+// support VAES (vector AES), VPCLMULQDQ (vector carryless multiplication), and
+// either AVX512 or AVX10.  Some of the functions, notably the encryption and
+// decryption update functions which are the most performance-critical, are
+// provided in two variants generated from a macro: one using 256-bit vectors
+// (suffix: vaes_avx10_256) and one using 512-bit vectors (vaes_avx10_512).  The
+// other, "shared" functions (vaes_avx10) use at most 256-bit vectors.
+//
+// The functions that use 512-bit vectors are intended for CPUs that support
+// 512-bit vectors *and* where using them doesn't cause significant
+// downclocking.  They require the following CPU features:
+//
+//	VAES && VPCLMULQDQ && BMI2 && ((AVX512BW && AVX512VL) || AVX10/512)
+//
+// The other functions require the following CPU features:
+//
+//	VAES && VPCLMULQDQ && BMI2 && ((AVX512BW && AVX512VL) || AVX10/256)
+//
+// All functions use the "System V" ABI.  The Windows ABI is not supported.
+//
+// Note that we use "avx10" in the names of the functions as a shorthand to
+// really mean "AVX10 or a certain set of AVX512 features".  Due to Intel's
+// introduction of AVX512 and then its replacement by AVX10, there doesn't seem
+// to be a simple way to name things that makes sense on all CPUs.
+//
+// Note that the macros that support both 256-bit and 512-bit vectors could
+// fairly easily be changed to support 128-bit too.  However, this would *not*
+// be sufficient to allow the code to run on CPUs without AVX512 or AVX10,
+// because the code heavily uses several features of these extensions other than
+// the vector length: the increase in the number of SIMD registers from 16 to
+// 32, masking support, and new instructions such as vpternlogd (which can do a
+// three-argument XOR).  These features are very useful for AES-GCM.

+// The _ghash_mul_step macro does one step of GHASH multiplication of the
+// 128-bit lanes of \a by the corresponding 128-bit lanes of \b and storing the
+// reduced products in \dst.  \t0, \t1, and \t2 are temporary registers of the
+// same size as \a and \b.  To complete all steps, this must invoked with \i=0
+// through \i=9.  The division into steps allows users of this macro to
+// optionally interleave the computation with other instructions.  Users of this
+// macro must preserve the parameter registers across steps.
+//
+// The multiplications are done in GHASH's representation of the finite field
+// GF(2^128).  Elements of GF(2^128) are represented as binary polynomials
+// (i.e. polynomials whose coefficients are bits) modulo a reducing polynomial
+// G.  The GCM specification uses G = x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1.  Addition is
+// just XOR, while multiplication is more complex and has two parts: (a) do
+// carryless multiplication of two 128-bit input polynomials to get a 256-bit
+// intermediate product polynomial, and (b) reduce the intermediate product to
+// 128 bits by adding multiples of G that cancel out terms in it.  (Adding
+// multiples of G doesn't change which field element the polynomial represents.)
+//
+// Unfortunately, the GCM specification maps bits to/from polynomial
+// coefficients backwards from the natural order.  In each byte it specifies the
+// highest bit to be the lowest order polynomial coefficient, *not* the highest!
+// This makes it nontrivial to work with the GHASH polynomials.  We could
+// reflect the bits, but x86 doesn't have an instruction that does that.
+//
+// Instead, we operate on the values without bit-reflecting them.  This *mostly*
+// just works, since XOR and carryless multiplication are symmetric with respect
+// to bit order, but it has some consequences.  First, due to GHASH's byte
+// order, by skipping bit reflection, *byte* reflection becomes necessary to
+// give the polynomial terms a consistent order.  E.g., considering an N-bit
+// value interpreted using the G = x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1 convention, bits 0
+// through N-1 of the byte-reflected value represent the coefficients of x^(N-1)
+// through x^0, whereas bits 0 through N-1 of the non-byte-reflected value
+// represent x^7...x^0, x^15...x^8, ..., x^(N-1)...x^(N-8) which can't be worked
+// with.  Fortunately, x86's vpshufb instruction can do byte reflection.
+//
+// Second, forgoing the bit reflection causes an extra multiple of x (still
+// using the G = x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1 convention) to be introduced by each
+// multiplication.  This is because an M-bit by N-bit carryless multiplication
+// really produces a (M+N-1)-bit product, but in practice it's zero-extended to
+// M+N bits.  In the G = x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1 convention, which maps bits
+// to polynomial coefficients backwards, this zero-extension actually changes
+// the product by introducing an extra factor of x.  Therefore, users of this
+// macro must ensure that one of the inputs has an extra factor of x^-1, i.e.
+// the multiplicative inverse of x, to cancel out the extra x.
+//
+// Third, the backwards coefficients convention is just confusing to work with,
+// since it makes "low" and "high" in the polynomial math mean the opposite of
+// their normal meaning in computer programming.  This can be solved by using an
+// alternative interpretation: the polynomial coefficients are understood to be
+// in the natural order, and the multiplication is actually \a * \b * x^-128 mod
+// x^128 + x^127 + x^126 + x^121 + 1.  This doesn't change the inputs, outputs,
+// or the implementation at all; it just changes the mathematical interpretation
+// of what each instruction is doing.  Starting from here, we'll use this
+// alternative interpretation, as it's easier to understand the code that way.
+//
+// Moving onto the implementation, the vpclmulqdq instruction does 64 x 64 =>
+// 128-bit carryless multiplication, so we break the 128 x 128 multiplication
+// into parts as follows (the _L and _H suffixes denote low and high 64 bits):
+//
+//     LO = a_L * b_L
+//     MI = (a_L * b_H) + (a_H * b_L)
+//     HI = a_H * b_H
+//
+// The 256-bit product is x^128*HI + x^64*MI + LO.  LO, MI, and HI are 128-bit.
+// Note that MI "overlaps" with LO and HI.  We don't consolidate MI into LO and
+// HI right away, since the way the reduction works makes that unnecessary.
+//
+// For the reduction, we cancel out the low 128 bits by adding multiples of G =
+// x^128 + x^127 + x^126 + x^121 + 1.  This is done by two iterations, each of
+// which cancels out the next lowest 64 bits.  Consider a value x^64*A + B,
+// where A and B are 128-bit.  Adding B_L*G to that value gives:
+//
+//       x^64*A + B + B_L*G
+//     = x^64*A + x^64*B_H + B_L + B_L*(x^128 + x^127 + x^126 + x^121 + 1)
+//     = x^64*A + x^64*B_H + B_L + x^128*B_L + x^64*B_L*(x^63 + x^62 + x^57) + B_L
+//     = x^64*A + x^64*B_H + x^128*B_L + x^64*B_L*(x^63 + x^62 + x^57) + B_L + B_L
+//     = x^64*(A + B_H + x^64*B_L + B_L*(x^63 + x^62 + x^57))
+//
+// So: if we sum A, B with its halves swapped, and the low half of B times x^63
+// + x^62 + x^57, we get a 128-bit value C where x^64*C is congruent to the
+// original value x^64*A + B.  I.e., the low 64 bits got canceled out.
+//
+// We just need to apply this twice: first to fold LO into MI, and second to
+// fold the updated MI into HI.
+//
+// The needed three-argument XORs are done using the vpternlogd instruction with
+// immediate 0x96, since this is faster than two vpxord instructions.
+//
+// A potential optimization, assuming that b is fixed per-key (if a is fixed
+// per-key it would work the other way around), is to use one iteration of the
+// reduction described above to precompute a value c such that x^64*c = b mod G,
+// and then multiply a_L by c (and implicitly by x^64) instead of by b:
+//
+//     MI = (a_L * c_L) + (a_H * b_L)
+//     HI = (a_L * c_H) + (a_H * b_H)
+//
+// This would eliminate the LO part of the intermediate product, which would
+// eliminate the need to fold LO into MI.  This would save two instructions,
+// including a vpclmulqdq.  However, we currently don't use this optimization
+// because it would require twice as many per-key precomputed values.
+//
+// Using Karatsuba multiplication instead of "schoolbook" multiplication
+// similarly would save a vpclmulqdq but does not seem to be worth it.

+/*
+ * This file implements AES-XTS for modern x86_64 CPUs.  To handle the
+ * complexities of coding for x86 SIMD, e.g. where every vector length needs
+ * different code, it uses a macro to generate several implementations that
+ * share similar source code but are targeted at different CPUs, listed below:
+ *
+ * AES-NI + AVX
+ *    - 128-bit vectors (1 AES block per vector)
+ *    - VEX-coded instructions
+ *    - xmm0-xmm15
+ *    - This is for older CPUs that lack VAES but do have AVX.
+ *
+ * VAES + VPCLMULQDQ + AVX2
+ *    - 256-bit vectors (2 AES blocks per vector)
+ *    - VEX-coded instructions
+ *    - ymm0-ymm15
+ *    - This is for CPUs that have VAES but lack AVX512 or AVX10,
+ *      e.g. Intel's Alder Lake and AMD's Zen 3.
+ *
+ * VAES + VPCLMULQDQ + AVX10/256 + BMI2
+ *    - 256-bit vectors (2 AES blocks per vector)
+ *    - EVEX-coded instructions
+ *    - ymm0-ymm31
+ *    - This is for CPUs that have AVX512 but where using zmm registers causes
+ *      downclocking, and for CPUs that have AVX10/256 but not AVX10/512.
+ *    - By "AVX10/256" we really mean (AVX512BW + AVX512VL) || AVX10/256.
+ *      To avoid confusion with 512-bit, we just write AVX10/256.
+ *
+ * VAES + VPCLMULQDQ + AVX10/512 + BMI2
+ *    - Same as the previous one, but upgrades to 512-bit vectors
+ *      (4 AES blocks per vector) in zmm0-zmm31.
+ *    - This is for CPUs that have good AVX512 or AVX10/512 support.
+ *
+ * This file doesn't have an implementation for AES-NI alone (without AVX), as
+ * the lack of VEX would make all the assembly code different.
+ *
+ * When we use VAES, we also use VPCLMULQDQ to parallelize the computation of
+ * the XTS tweaks.  This avoids a bottleneck.  Currently there don't seem to be
+ * any CPUs that support VAES but not VPCLMULQDQ.  If that changes, we might
+ * need to start also providing an implementation using VAES alone.
+ *
+ * The AES-XTS implementations in this file support everything required by the

 and appropriate to the current workload.
 
+``amd-pstate`` Preferred Core
+=================================
+
+The core frequency is subjected to the process variation in semiconductors.
+Not all cores are able to reach the maximum frequency respecting the
+infrastructure limits. Consequently, AMD has redefined the concept of
+maximum frequency of a part. This means that a fraction of cores can reach
+maximum frequency. To find the best process scheduling policy for a given
+scenario, OS needs to know the core ordering informed by the platform through
+highest performance capability register of the CPPC interface.
+
+``amd-pstate`` preferred core enables the scheduler to prefer scheduling on
+cores that can achieve a higher frequency with lower voltage. The preferred
+core rankings can dynamically change based on the workload, platform conditions,
+thermals and ageing.
+
+The priority metric will be initialized by the ``amd-pstate`` driver. The ``amd-pstate``
+driver will also determine whether or not ``amd-pstate`` preferred core is
+supported by the platform.
+
+``amd-pstate`` driver will provide an initial core ordering when the system boots.
+The platform uses the CPPC interfaces to communicate the core ranking to the
+operating system and scheduler to make sure that OS is choosing the cores
+with highest performance firstly for scheduling the process. When ``amd-pstate``
+driver receives a message with the highest performance change, it will
+update the core ranking and set the cpu's priority.
+
+``amd-pstate`` Preferred Core Switch

+Enable/disable states can be chosen by different kernel parameters.

+
+For systems that support ``amd-pstate`` preferred core, the core rankings will
+always be advertised by the platform. But OS can choose to ignore that via the
+kernel parameter ``amd_prefcore=disable``.

+/* BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) congestion control
  *
- * BBR congestion control computes the sending rate based on the delivery
- * rate (throughput) estimated from ACKs. In a nutshell:
+ * BBR is a model-based congestion control algorithm that aims for low queues,
+ * low loss, and (bounded) Reno/CUBIC coexistence. To maintain a model of the
+ * network path, it uses measurements of bandwidth and RTT, as well as (if they
+ * occur) packet loss and/or shallow-threshold ECN signals. Note that although
+ * it can use ECN or loss signals explicitly, it does not require either; it
+ * can bound its in-flight data based on its estimate of the BDP.
  *
- *   On each ACK, update our model of the network path:
- *      bottleneck_bandwidth = windowed_max(delivered / elapsed, 10 round trips)
- *      min_rtt = windowed_min(rtt, 10 seconds)
- *   pacing_rate = pacing_gain * bottleneck_bandwidth
- *   cwnd = max(cwnd_gain * bottleneck_bandwidth * min_rtt, 4)
- *
- * The core algorithm does not react directly to packet losses or delays,
- * although BBR may adjust the size of next send per ACK when loss is
- * observed, or adjust the sending rate if it estimates there is a
- * traffic policer, in order to keep the drop rate reasonable.
+ * The model has both higher and lower bounds for the operating range:
+ *   lo: bw_lo, inflight_lo: conservative short-term lower bound
+ *   hi: bw_hi, inflight_hi: robust long-term upper bound
+ * The bandwidth-probing time scale is (a) extended dynamically based on
+ * estimated BDP to improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC; (b) bounded by
+ * an interactive wall-clock time-scale to be more scalable and responsive
+ * than Reno and CUBIC.
  *

+ * Intel remapped NVMe device support.
+ *
+ * Copyright (c) 2019 Endless Mobile, Inc.
+ * Author: Daniel Drake <drake@endlessm.com>
+ *
+ * Some products ship by default with the SATA controller in "RAID" or
+ * "Intel RST Premium With Intel Optane System Acceleration" mode. Under this
+ * mode, which we refer to as "remapped NVMe" mode, any installed NVMe
+ * devices disappear from the PCI bus, and instead their I/O memory becomes
+ * available within the AHCI device BARs.
+ *
+ * This scheme is understood to be a way of avoiding usage of the standard
+ * Windows NVMe driver under that OS, instead mandating usage of Intel's
+ * driver instead, which has better power management, and presumably offers
+ * some RAID/disk-caching solutions too.
+ *
+ * Here in this driver, we support the remapped NVMe mode by claiming the
+ * AHCI device and creating a fake PCIe root port. On the new bus, the
+ * original AHCI device is exposed with only minor tweaks. Then, fake PCI
+ * devices corresponding to the remapped NVMe devices are created. The usual
+ * ahci and nvme drivers are then expected to bind to these devices and
+ * operate as normal.
+ *
+ * The PCI configuration space for the NVMe devices is completely
+ * unavailable, so we fake a minimal one and hope for the best.
+ *
+ * Interrupts are shared between the AHCI and NVMe devices. For simplicity,
+ * we only support the legacy interrupt here, although MSI support
+ * could potentially be added later.

+Description:	Set the mode the ROG Ally xpad operates in:
+		- 1 = Game mode
+		- 2 = WASD mode
+		- 3 = Mouse mode
+		This setting applies instantly and applies settings that were previously changed
+		under that mode which are:
+		- deadzones
+		- anti-deadzones
+		- button mapping
+		- button turbo settings
+		- response curves

+===================================
+NT synchronization primitive driver
+===================================
+
+This page documents the user-space API for the ntsync driver.
+
+ntsync is a support driver for emulation of NT synchronization
+primitives by user-space NT emulators. It exists because implementation
+in user-space, using existing tools, cannot match Windows performance
+while offering accurate semantics. It is implemented entirely in
+software, and does not drive any hardware device.
+
+This interface is meant as a compatibility tool only, and should not
+be used for general synchronization. Instead use generic, versatile
+interfaces such as futex(2) and poll(2).
+
+Synchronization primitives
+==========================
+
+The ntsync driver exposes three types of synchronization primitives:
+semaphores, mutexes, and events.
+
+A semaphore holds a single volatile 32-bit counter, and a static 32-bit
+integer denoting the maximum value. It is considered signaled (that is,
+can be acquired without contention, or will wake up a waiting thread)
+when the counter is nonzero. The counter is decremented by one when a
+wait is satisfied. Both the initial and maximum count are established
+when the semaphore is created.
+
+A mutex holds a volatile 32-bit recursion count, and a volatile 32-bit
+identifier denoting its owner. A mutex is considered signaled when its
+owner is zero (indicating that it is not owned). The recursion count is
+incremented when a wait is satisfied, and ownership is set to the given
+identifier.
+
+A mutex also holds an internal flag denoting whether its previous owner
+has died; such a mutex is said to be abandoned. Owner death is not
+tracked automatically based on thread death, but rather must be
+communicated using ``NTSYNC_IOC_MUTEX_KILL``. An abandoned mutex is
+inherently considered unowned.
+
+Except for the "unowned" semantics of zero, the actual value of the
+owner identifier is not interpreted by the ntsync driver at all. The
+intended use is to store a thread identifier; however, the ntsync
+driver does not actually validate that a calling thread provides
+consistent or unique identifiers.
+
+An event is similar to a semaphore with a maximum count of one. It holds
+a volatile boolean state denoting whether it is signaled or not. There
+are two types of events, auto-reset and manual-reset. An auto-reset
+event is designaled when a wait is satisfied; a manual-reset event is
+not. The event type is specified when the event is created.
+
+Unless specified otherwise, all operations on an object are atomic and
+totally ordered with respect to other operations on the same object.
+
+Objects are represented by files. When all file descriptors to an
+object are closed, that object is deleted.
+
+Char device
+===========
+
+The ntsync driver creates a single char device /dev/ntsync. Each file
+description opened on the device represents a unique instance intended
+to back an individual NT virtual machine. Objects created by one ntsync
+instance may only be used with other objects created by the same
+instance.
+
+ioctl reference
+===============
+
+All operations on the device are done through ioctls. There are four
+structures used in ioctl calls::
+
+   struct ntsync_sem_args {
+   	__u32 sem;
+   	__u32 count;
+   	__u32 max;
+   };
+
+   struct ntsync_mutex_args {
+   	__u32 mutex;
+   	__u32 owner;
+   	__u32 count;
+   };
+
+   struct ntsync_event_args {
+   	__u32 event;
+   	__u32 signaled;
+   	__u32 manual;
+   };
+
+   struct ntsync_wait_args {
+   	__u64 timeout;
+   	__u64 objs;
+   	__u32 count;
+   	__u32 owner;
+   	__u32 index;
+   	__u32 alert;
+   	__u32 flags;
+   	__u32 pad;
+   };
+
+Depending on the ioctl, members of the structure may be used as input,
+output, or not at all. All ioctls return 0 on success.
+
+The ioctls on the device file are as follows:
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_CREATE_SEM
+
+  Create a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - On output, contains a file descriptor to the created semaphore.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Initial count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - Maximum count of the semaphore.
+
+  Fails with ``EINVAL`` if ``count`` is greater than ``max``.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_CREATE_MUTEX
+
+  Create a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - On output, contains a file descriptor to the created mutex.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Initial recursion count of the mutex.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Initial owner of the mutex.
+
+  If ``owner`` is nonzero and ``count`` is zero, or if ``owner`` is
+  zero and ``count`` is nonzero, the function fails with ``EINVAL``.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_CREATE_EVENT
+
+  Create an event object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_event_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``event``
+       - On output, contains a file descriptor to the created event.
+     * - ``signaled``
+       - If nonzero, the event is initially signaled, otherwise
+         nonsignaled.
+     * - ``manual``
+       - If nonzero, the event is a manual-reset event, otherwise
+         auto-reset.
+
+The ioctls on the individual objects are as follows:
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_SEM_POST
+
+  Post to a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to a 32-bit integer,
+  which on input holds the count to be added to the semaphore, and on
+  output contains its previous count.
+
+  If adding to the semaphore's current count would raise the latter
+  past the semaphore's maximum count, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOVERFLOW`` and the semaphore is not affected. If raising the
+  semaphore's count causes it to become signaled, eligible threads
+  waiting on this semaphore will be woken and the semaphore's count
+  decremented appropriately.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_MUTEX_UNLOCK
+
+  Release a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - Ignored.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Specifies the owner trying to release this mutex.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the previous recursion count.
+
+  If ``owner`` is zero, the ioctl fails with ``EINVAL``. If ``owner``
+  is not the current owner of the mutex, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EPERM``.
+
+  The mutex's count will be decremented by one. If decrementing the
+  mutex's count causes it to become zero, the mutex is marked as
+  unowned and signaled, and eligible threads waiting on it will be
+  woken as appropriate.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_SET_EVENT
+
+  Signal an event object. Takes a pointer to a 32-bit integer, which on
+  output contains the previous state of the event.
+
+  Eligible threads will be woken, and auto-reset events will be
+  designaled appropriately.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_RESET_EVENT
+
+  Designal an event object. Takes a pointer to a 32-bit integer, which
+  on output contains the previous state of the event.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_PULSE_EVENT
+
+  Wake threads waiting on an event object while leaving it in an
+  unsignaled state. Takes a pointer to a 32-bit integer, which on
+  output contains the previous state of the event.
+
+  A pulse operation can be thought of as a set followed by a reset,
+  performed as a single atomic operation. If two threads are waiting on
+  an auto-reset event which is pulsed, only one will be woken. If two
+  threads are waiting a manual-reset event which is pulsed, both will
+  be woken. However, in both cases, the event will be unsignaled
+  afterwards, and a simultaneous read operation will always report the
+  event as unsignaled.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_READ_SEM
+
+  Read the current state of a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to
+  struct :c:type:`ntsync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - Ignored.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the current count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - On output, contains the maximum count of the semaphore.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_READ_MUTEX
+
+  Read the current state of a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - Ignored.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - On output, contains the current owner of the mutex, or zero
+         if the mutex is not currently owned.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the current recursion count of the mutex.
+
+  If the mutex is marked as abandoned, the function fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. In this case, ``count`` and ``owner`` are set to
+  zero.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_READ_EVENT
+
+  Read the current state of an event object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`ntsync_event_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``event``
+       - Ignored.
+     * - ``signaled``
+       - On output, contains the current state of the event.
+     * - ``manual``
+       - On output, contains 1 if the event is a manual-reset event,
+         and 0 otherwise.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_KILL_OWNER
+
+  Mark a mutex as unowned and abandoned if it is owned by the given
+  owner. Takes an input-only pointer to a 32-bit integer denoting the
+  owner. If the owner is zero, the ioctl fails with ``EINVAL``. If the
+  owner does not own the mutex, the function fails with ``EPERM``.
+
+  Eligible threads waiting on the mutex will be woken as appropriate
+  (and such waits will fail with ``EOWNERDEAD``, as described below).
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY
+
+  Poll on any of a list of objects, atomically acquiring at most one.
+  Takes a pointer to struct :c:type:`ntsync_wait_args`, which is
+  used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``timeout``
+       - Absolute timeout in nanoseconds. If ``NTSYNC_WAIT_REALTIME``
+         is set, the timeout is measured against the REALTIME clock;
+         otherwise it is measured against the MONOTONIC clock. If the
+         timeout is equal to or earlier than the current time, the
+         function returns immediately without sleeping. If ``timeout``
+         is U64_MAX, the function will sleep until an object is
+         signaled, and will not fail with ``ETIMEDOUT``.
+     * - ``objs``
+       - Pointer to an array of ``count`` file descriptors
+         (specified as an integer so that the structure has the same
+         size regardless of architecture). If any object is
+         invalid, the function fails with ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Number of objects specified in the ``objs`` array.
+         If greater than ``NTSYNC_MAX_WAIT_COUNT``, the function fails
+         with ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Mutex owner identifier. If any object in ``objs`` is a mutex,
+         the ioctl will attempt to acquire that mutex on behalf of
+         ``owner``. If ``owner`` is zero, the ioctl fails with
+         ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``index``
+       - On success, contains the index (into ``objs``) of the object
+         which was signaled. If ``alert`` was signaled instead,
+         this contains ``count``.
+     * - ``alert``
+       - Optional event object file descriptor. If nonzero, this
+         specifies an "alert" event object which, if signaled, will
+         terminate the wait. If nonzero, the identifier must point to a
+         valid event.
+     * - ``flags``
+       - Zero or more flags. Currently the only flag is
+         ``NTSYNC_WAIT_REALTIME``, which causes the timeout to be
+         measured against the REALTIME clock instead of MONOTONIC.
+     * - ``pad``
+       - Unused, must be set to zero.
+
+  This function attempts to acquire one of the given objects. If unable
+  to do so, it sleeps until an object becomes signaled, subsequently
+  acquiring it, or the timeout expires. In the latter case the ioctl
+  fails with ``ETIMEDOUT``. The function only acquires one object, even
+  if multiple objects are signaled.
+
+  A semaphore is considered to be signaled if its count is nonzero, and
+  is acquired by decrementing its count by one. A mutex is considered
+  to be signaled if it is unowned or if its owner matches the ``owner``
+  argument, and is acquired by incrementing its recursion count by one
+  and setting its owner to the ``owner`` argument. An auto-reset event
+  is acquired by designaling it; a manual-reset event is not affected
+  by acquisition.
+
+  Acquisition is atomic and totally ordered with respect to other
+  operations on the same object. If two wait operations (with different
+  ``owner`` identifiers) are queued on the same mutex, only one is
+  signaled. If two wait operations are queued on the same semaphore,
+  and a value of one is posted to it, only one is signaled.
+
+  If an abandoned mutex is acquired, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. Although this is a failure return, the function may
+  otherwise be considered successful. The mutex is marked as owned by
+  the given owner (with a recursion count of 1) and as no longer
+  abandoned, and ``index`` is still set to the index of the mutex.
+
+  The ``alert`` argument is an "extra" event which can terminate the
+  wait, independently of all other objects.
+
+  It is valid to pass the same object more than once, including by
+  passing the same event in the ``objs`` array and in ``alert``. If a
+  wakeup occurs due to that object being signaled, ``index`` is set to
+  the lowest index corresponding to that object.
+
+  The function may fail with ``EINTR`` if a signal is received.
+
+.. c:macro:: NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ALL
+
+  Poll on a list of objects, atomically acquiring all of them. Takes a
+  pointer to struct :c:type:`ntsync_wait_args`, which is used
+  identically to ``NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, except that ``index`` is
+  always filled with zero on success if not woken via alert.
+
+  This function attempts to simultaneously acquire all of the given
+  objects. If unable to do so, it sleeps until all objects become
+  simultaneously signaled, subsequently acquiring them, or the timeout
+  expires. In the latter case the ioctl fails with ``ETIMEDOUT`` and no
+  objects are modified.
+
+  Objects may become signaled and subsequently designaled (through
+  acquisition by other threads) while this thread is sleeping. Only
+  once all objects are simultaneously signaled does the ioctl acquire
+  them and return. The entire acquisition is atomic and totally ordered
+  with respect to other operations on any of the given objects.
+
+  If an abandoned mutex is acquired, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. Similarly to ``NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, all objects are
+  nevertheless marked as acquired. Note that if multiple mutex objects
+  are specified, there is no way to know which were marked as
+  abandoned.
+
+  As with "any" waits, the ``alert`` argument is an "extra" event which
+  can terminate the wait. Critically, however, an "all" wait will
+  succeed if all members in ``objs`` are signaled, *or* if ``alert`` is
+  signaled. In the latter case ``index`` will be set to ``count``. As
+  with "any" waits, if both conditions are filled, the former takes
+  priority, and objects in ``objs`` will be acquired.
+
+  Unlike ``NTSYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, it is not valid to pass the same
+  object more than once, nor is it valid to pass the same object in
+  ``objs`` and in ``alert``. If this is attempted, the function fails
+  with ``EINVAL``.

+/* ********************* BLOCK-LEVEL SEQUENCE PRODUCER API *********************
+ *
+ * *** OVERVIEW ***
+ * The Block-Level Sequence Producer API allows users to provide their own custom
+ * sequence producer which libzstd invokes to process each block. The produced list
+ * of sequences (literals and matches) is then post-processed by libzstd to produce
+ * valid compressed blocks.
+ *
+ * This block-level offload API is a more granular complement of the existing
+ * frame-level offload API compressSequences() (introduced in v1.5.1). It offers
+ * an easier migration story for applications already integrated with libzstd: the
+ * user application continues to invoke the same compression functions
+ * ZSTD_compress2() or ZSTD_compressStream2() as usual, and transparently benefits
+ * from the specific advantages of the external sequence producer. For example,
+ * the sequence producer could be tuned to take advantage of known characteristics
+ * of the input, to offer better speed / ratio, or could leverage hardware
+ * acceleration not available within libzstd itself.
+ *
+ * See contrib/externalSequenceProducer for an example program employing the
+ * Block-Level Sequence Producer API.
+ *
+ * *** USAGE ***
+ * The user is responsible for implementing a function of type
+ * ZSTD_sequenceProducer_F. For each block, zstd will pass the following
+ * arguments to the user-provided function:
+ *
+ *   - sequenceProducerState: a pointer to a user-managed state for the sequence
+ *     producer.
+ *
+ *   - outSeqs, outSeqsCapacity: an output buffer for the sequence producer.
+ *     outSeqsCapacity is guaranteed >= ZSTD_sequenceBound(srcSize). The memory
+ *     backing outSeqs is managed by the CCtx.
+ *
+ *   - src, srcSize: an input buffer for the sequence producer to parse.
+ *     srcSize is guaranteed to be <= ZSTD_BLOCKSIZE_MAX.
+ *
+ *   - dict, dictSize: a history buffer, which may be empty, which the sequence
+ *     producer may reference as it parses the src buffer. Currently, zstd will
+ *     always pass dictSize == 0 into external sequence producers, but this will
+ *     change in the future.
+ *
+ *   - compressionLevel: a signed integer representing the zstd compression level
+ *     set by the user for the current operation. The sequence producer may choose
+ *     to use this information to change its compression strategy and speed/ratio
+ *     tradeoff. Note: the compression level does not reflect zstd parameters set
+ *     through the advanced API.
+ *
+ *   - windowSize: a size_t representing the maximum allowed offset for external
+ *     sequences. Note that sequence offsets are sometimes allowed to exceed the
+ *     windowSize if a dictionary is present, see doc/zstd_compression_format.md
+ *     for details.
+ *
+ * The user-provided function shall return a size_t representing the number of
+ * sequences written to outSeqs. This return value will be treated as an error
+ * code if it is greater than outSeqsCapacity. The return value must be non-zero
+ * if srcSize is non-zero. The ZSTD_SEQUENCE_PRODUCER_ERROR macro is provided
+ * for convenience, but any value greater than outSeqsCapacity will be treated as
+ * an error code.
+ *
+ * If the user-provided function does not return an error code, the sequences
+ * written to outSeqs must be a valid parse of the src buffer. Data corruption may
+ * occur if the parse is not valid. A parse is defined to be valid if the
+ * following conditions hold:
+ *   - The sum of matchLengths and literalLengths must equal srcSize.
+ *   - All sequences in the parse, except for the final sequence, must have
+ *     matchLength >= ZSTD_MINMATCH_MIN. The final sequence must have
+ *     matchLength >= ZSTD_MINMATCH_MIN or matchLength == 0.
+ *   - All offsets must respect the windowSize parameter as specified in
+ *     doc/zstd_compression_format.md.
+ *   - If the final sequence has matchLength == 0, it must also have offset == 0.
+ *
+ * zstd will only validate these conditions (and fail compression if they do not
+ * hold) if the ZSTD_c_validateSequences cParam is enabled. Note that sequence
+ * validation has a performance cost.
+ *
+ * If the user-provided function returns an error, zstd will either fall back
+ * to an internal sequence producer or fail the compression operation. The user can
+ * choose between the two behaviors by setting the ZSTD_c_enableSeqProducerFallback
+ * cParam. Fallback compression will follow any other cParam settings, such as
+ * compression level, the same as in a normal compression operation.
+ *
+ * The user shall instruct zstd to use a particular ZSTD_sequenceProducer_F
+ * function by calling
+ *         ZSTD_registerSequenceProducer(cctx,
+ *                                       sequenceProducerState,
+ *                                       sequenceProducer)
+ * This setting will persist until the next parameter reset of the CCtx.
+ *
+ * The sequenceProducerState must be initialized by the user before calling
+ * ZSTD_registerSequenceProducer(). The user is responsible for destroying the
+ * sequenceProducerState.
+ *
+ * *** LIMITATIONS ***
+ * This API is compatible with all zstd compression APIs which respect advanced parameters.
+ * However, there are three limitations:
+ *
+ * First, the ZSTD_c_enableLongDistanceMatching cParam is not currently supported.
+ * COMPRESSION WILL FAIL if it is enabled and the user tries to compress with a block-level
+ * external sequence producer.
+ *   - Note that ZSTD_c_enableLongDistanceMatching is auto-enabled by default in some
+ *     cases (see its documentation for details). Users must explicitly set
+ *     ZSTD_c_enableLongDistanceMatching to ZSTD_ps_disable in such cases if an external
+ *     sequence producer is registered.
+ *   - As of this writing, ZSTD_c_enableLongDistanceMatching is disabled by default
+ *     whenever ZSTD_c_windowLog < 128MB, but that's subject to change. Users should
+ *     check the docs on ZSTD_c_enableLongDistanceMatching whenever the Block-Level Sequence
+ *     Producer API is used in conjunction with advanced settings (like ZSTD_c_windowLog).
+ *
+ * Second, history buffers are not currently supported. Concretely, zstd will always pass
+ * dictSize == 0 to the external sequence producer (for now). This has two implications:
+ *   - Dictionaries are not currently supported. Compression will *not* fail if the user
+ *     references a dictionary, but the dictionary won't have any effect.
+ *   - Stream history is not currently supported. All advanced compression APIs, including
+ *     streaming APIs, work with external sequence producers, but each block is treated as
+ *     an independent chunk without history from previous blocks.
+ *
+ * Third, multi-threading within a single compression is not currently supported. In other words,
+ * COMPRESSION WILL FAIL if ZSTD_c_nbWorkers > 0 and an external sequence producer is registered.
+ * Multi-threading across compressions is fine: simply create one CCtx per thread.
+ *
+ * Long-term, we plan to overcome all three limitations. There is no technical blocker to
+ * overcoming them. It is purely a question of engineering effort.
